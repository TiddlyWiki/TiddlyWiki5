title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/readme

This plugin enhances TiddlyWiki by automatically generating links to existing tiddler titles within text, improving navigation and connectivity.

''Note: Automatic link generation may experience performance slowdowns with a large number of tiddlers. The plugin leverages an optimized Aho-Corasick algorithm to mitigate this, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets.''

Freelinking is activated for text runs where the following variables are configured:

* `tv-wikilinks` is NOT set to `no`
* `tv-freelinks` is set to `yes`

By default, freelinking is case-sensitive, but this can be toggled to ignore case via the settings tab. Additionally, a Word Boundary Check can be enabled to control linking precision, configurable under the Freelinks settings panel. The plugin supports non-Western language tiddler titles (e.g., Chinese) and prioritizes longer tiddler titles for matching, ensuring accurate linking in diverse contexts. Furthermore, the current tiddler title within its own content is excluded from generating links to avoid self-referencing.

Within view templates, the variable `tv-freelinks` is automatically set to the value of `$:/config/Freelinks/Enable`, which can be adjusted through the plugin's settings interface.

!! Configuration Notes

To customize which tiddlers trigger freelinking, modify the shadow tiddler [[$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/macros/view]]. This tiddler is tagged `$:/tags/Macro/View`, ensuring it acts as a local macro in each view template. The default content is:

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{$:/config/Freelinks/Enable}}/>
```

This sets `tv-freelinks` to the value of `$:/config/Freelinks/Enable` (either "yes" or "no") for each tiddler, as defined in the control panel settings.

For more specific control, you can use filter expressions. For example, to enable freelinking only within the tiddler titled "HelloThere":

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

To limit freelinking to tiddlers tagged "MyTag":

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>tag[MyTags]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

You can also combine conditions, such as freelinking only for "HelloThere" with the "MyTag" tag:

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]] ~[<currentTiddler>tag[MyTag]] +[then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

!! Additional Features<br>
- Adjust the target filter (`$:/config/Freelinks/TargetFilter`) to define which tiddlers are considered for linking.<br>
- Enable "Word Boundary Check" in the settings to refine linking behavior (applies only to Western languages):<br>
  - **Enabled** (defalut): Only standalone words are linked (e.g., @@__Yes__@@ eyes eYes → only "Yes" is linked).<br>
  - **Disabled**: Partial matches within words are linked (e.g., @@__yes__@@ eyes e@@__Yes__@@ → "Yes" and e"Yes" are linked).
- The plugin prioritizes longer tiddler titles for matching, ensuring that phrases like "Game Guide" are linked before "Game" alone.<br>
