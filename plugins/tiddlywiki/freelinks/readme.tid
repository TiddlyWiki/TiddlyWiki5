title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/readme

This plugin enhances TiddlyWiki by automatically generating links to existing tiddler titles within text, improving navigation and connectivity.

''Note: Automatic link generation may experience performance slowdowns with a large number of tiddlers. For optimal performance, consider enabling the persistent cache option in the settings.''

Freelinking is activated for text runs where the following variables are configured:

* `tv-wikilinks` is NOT set to `no`
* `tv-freelinks` is set to `yes`

By default, freelinking is case-sensitive, but this can be toggled to ignore case via the settings tab. Additionally, a persistent Aho-Corasick cache can be enabled to boost performance, configurable under the Freelinks settings panel.

Within view templates, the variable `tv-freelinks` is automatically set to the value of `$:/config/Freelinks/Enable`, which can be adjusted through the plugin's settings interface.

!! Configuration Notes

To customize which tiddlers trigger freelinking, modify the shadow tiddler [[$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/macros/view]]. This tiddler is tagged `$:/tags/Macro/View`, ensuring it acts as a local macro in each view template. The default content is:

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{$:/config/Freelinks/Enable}}/>
```

This sets `tv-freelinks` to the value of `$:/config/Freelinks/Enable` (either "yes" or "no") for each tiddler, as defined in the control panel settings.

For more specific control, you can use filter expressions. For example, to enable freelinking only within the tiddler titled "HelloThere":

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

To limit freelinking to tiddlers tagged "MyTag":

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>tag[MyTags]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

You can also combine conditions, such as freelinking only for "HelloThere" with the "MyTag" tag:

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]] ~[<currentTiddler>tag[MyTag]] +[then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

!! Additional Features
- Use the settings panel to enable a persistent cache, leveraging an optimized Aho-Corasick algorithm to handle large tiddler sets efficiently.
- Adjust the target filter (`$:/config/Freelinks/TargetFilter`) to define which tiddlers are considered for linking.

- Powered by Grok & Claude, enhancing development with advanced AI assistance.
