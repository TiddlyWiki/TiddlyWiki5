This plugin provides several tools for working with Amazon Web Services:

* Templates for saving a TiddlyWiki as a single JavaScript file in a ZIP file that can be executed as an AWS Lambda function. In this form, TiddlyWiki is a self contained single file containing both code and data, just like the standalone HTML file configuration
* Commands that can be used to interact with AWS services, under both the Node.js and Lambda configurations of TiddlyWiki
* A new "aws-encodeuricomponent" filter that acts like the core "encodeuricomponent" filter except it additionally encodes the single quote character
