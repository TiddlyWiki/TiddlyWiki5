This is a TiddlyWiki plugin for mathematical and chemical typesetting based on [ext[KaTeX from Khan Academy|http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/]] (v0.12.0) and [ext[mhchem|https://github.com/mhchem/MathJax-mhchem]] through a [ext[Katex extension|https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/tree/master/contrib/mhchem]].

It is completely self-contained, and doesn't need an Internet connection in order to work. It works both in the browser and under Node.js.
