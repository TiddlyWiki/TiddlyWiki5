title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/multiwikiserver/readme

This plugin extends the TiddlyWiki 5 server running on Node.js to be able to host multiple wikis that can share content or be independent.

Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5.git --branch multi-wiki-support

cd TiddlyWiki5

npm install
```

To start the server:

```
npm start
```

The `npm start` command is a shortcut for the following command:

```
node ./tiddlywiki.js ./editions/multiwikiserver --listen
```

Then visit the administration interface in a browser:

* http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Note that changes are written to the topmost bag in a recipe.

Note that until syncing is improved it is necessary to use "Get latest changes from the server" to speed up propogation of changes.

To run the tests:

```
./bin/test.sh
```
