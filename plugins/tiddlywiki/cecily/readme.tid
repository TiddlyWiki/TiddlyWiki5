This experimental plugin provides a new story visualisation that displays individual tiddlers as resizable tiles on an infinite canvas.

Cecily is based on an earlier plugin for TiddlyWiki Classic: http://jermolene.com/cecily

Cecily is currently in the early stages of development with little functionality yet implemented.
