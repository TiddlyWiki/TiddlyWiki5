caption: makeqr Macro

The ''makeqr'' [[macro|Macros]] converts text data into an image of the corresponding QR code. The image is returned as [[base64-encoded data URI|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs]].

!! Parameters

;text
: The text to encode
;size
: The size of the image in pixels (defaults to 500)
;errorCorrectLevel
: Determines the amount of error correction applied to the image; see below (defaults to "M").
;fallback
: The fallback image to be returned in case of an error (see below)

The conversion will fail if the text is too long and/or complex and the macro will return the provided fallback image. If no fallback image is provided then an error image is generated.

The error correction level is a [[QR code feature|http://www.qrcode.com/en/about/error_correction.html]]:
