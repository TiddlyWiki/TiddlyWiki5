This is a TiddlyWiki plugin for parsing Markdown text, using the [[Remarkable|https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable]] library. If the KaTeX TiddlyWiki plugin is installed, KaTeX support is enabled using the [[remarkable-katex|https://github.com/bradhowes/remarkable-katex]] Remarkable plugin.

It is completely self-contained, and doesn't need an Internet connection in order to work. It works both in the browser and under Node.js.
