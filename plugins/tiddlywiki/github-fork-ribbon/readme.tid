This plugin provides a diagonal ribbon across the corner of the window. It resembles the design used by ~GitHub for their "Fork me on ~GitHub" ribbons.

The ribbon can be positioned over any corner, and can incorporate user defined text, colours and a link.

The CSS stylesheet is adapted from work by [[Simon Whitaker|https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css/]]
