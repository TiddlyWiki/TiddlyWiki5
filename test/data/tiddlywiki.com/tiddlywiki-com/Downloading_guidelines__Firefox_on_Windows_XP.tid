Follow these steps to get started! These guidelines are for Firefox 3.0.1 running on Microsoft Windows XP, Service Pack 3. Hopefully they will be helpful for your setup too.

''If these guidelines aren't appropriate, check the [[other browser-specific guidelines|Downloading]] to find some that are right for you.''
!Step 1 - Download file
You'll need to choose a name and location for your empty ~TiddlyWiki file - we recommend either your Desktop or My Documents folder. Make sure you leave the "Save as type: Firefox Document" default option as it is. Then click 'Save'.
