Your browser only supports manual saving.

To save your modified wiki, right click on the download link below and select "Download file" or "Save file", and then choose the folder and filename.

//You can marginally speed things up by clicking the link with the control key (Windows) or the options/alt key (Mac OS X). You will not be prompted for the folder or filename, but your browser is likely to give it an unrecognizable nameâ€”you may need to rename the file to include the `.html` extension before you can do anything useful with it.//

On smartphones that do not allow files to be downloaded you can instead bookmark the link, and then sync your bookmarks to a desktop computer from where the wiki can be saved normally.
