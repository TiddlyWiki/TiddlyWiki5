description: Saves a raw tiddler to a file

Saves an individual tiddler in its raw text or binary format to the specified filename. 

```
--savetiddler <title> <filename>
```

By default, the filename is resolved relative to the `output` subdirectory of the edition directory. The `--output` command can be used to direct output to a different directory.

Any missing directories in the path to the filename are automatically created.
