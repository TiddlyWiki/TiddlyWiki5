''Hello! My name is Eric Shulman''. I am the author of ''[[www.TiddlyTools.com|http://www.TiddlyTools.com]] (Small Tools for Big Ideas! &trade;)'', a popular collection of original plugins, macros, widgets, templates and stylesheets for TiddlyWiki that I have created and shared with the TiddlyWiki community.

Think of TiddlyTools as a ''virtual hardware store and "demonstration showroom"'', offering tools, parts and techniques that provide a rich variety of new functionality and feature enhancements to help you ''turn a general-purpose TiddlyWiki "info-house" into a comfortable, custom-built "info-home"''.

The TiddlyWiki core system provides the basic structure and utilities: the foundation, framing, walls, roof, windows/doors, plumbing, heating, and electrical systems. Then, TiddlyTools helps you with all the "finish work": the appliances, fixtures, lighting, cabinets, furniture, paint, wallpaper, carpeting, etc. ''to best suit your specific needs and personal style''.

Since the early days of TiddlyWiki (April 2005), I have worked closely with its inventor, [[Jeremy Ruston|https://jermolene.com/]], to help develop and improve TiddlyWiki's core functions. I am also a key contributor and administrator of the online TiddlyWiki [[Discourse|https://talk.TiddlyWiki.org]] and [[GoogleGroups|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywiki]] discussion forums, providing ongoing assistance to the worldwide TiddlyWiki community. I have written over 15,000 detailed responses to individual questions posted online.  For several years I was also the lead developer and maintainer of the [[TiddlyWiki Classic|https://classic.tiddlywiki.com/]] codebase.

I was born and raised in suburban Long Island, NY, and attended [[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)|https://www.cmu.edu/]] in Pittsburgh, PA, where I studied ''Computer Science, Cognitive Psychology, Sociology, Human Factors Design, and Artificial Intelligence''. As an undergraduate at CMU, I was privileged to work with some of the major luminaries in early software research and design, including <<wiki "Herbert Simon" "Herbert_A._Simon">>, <<wiki "Allen Newell" "Allen_Newell">>, <<wiki "James Gosling" "James_Gosling">>, and <<wiki "Raj Reddy" "Raj_Reddy">>. I was also employed in several Computer Science Department research projects, including the development of speech recognition technologies, graphical interface systems, and interactive applications for instruction in physics, art and music. I received a ''Bachelor of Science in "Interactive Systems Design"'' from CMU in 1985.

During my early post-graduate years, I worked for several notable software development companies, including 
<<wiki "Honeywell Information Systems" "Honeywell#Honeywell_Information_Systems">> and <<wiki "Lotus Software" "Lotus_Software">>. I was an integral member of the <<wiki "1-2-3 spreadsheet" 
"Lotus_1-2-3">> development team where I helped create the first GUI-based application interfaces for Microsoft Windows and IBM OS/2.

Since 1998, I have been an ''independent design consultant'', living and working in Silicon Valley, where I apply more than 40 years of experience to provide ''analysis, design and software development services'' for commercial companies and not-for-profit organizations, with emphasis on ''information architecture'' and ''interaction/visual design standards'' to improve ease-of-use for new and existing software products and online environments.
