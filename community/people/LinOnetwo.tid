Since 2014, when I started college, I've been on a quest for a lifelong PKM tool. I cherish my life and all my experiences, and I don’t want to forget any of them. When I’m deeply focused on a task, it’s easy to lose sight of other important parts of my life—so I needed a system to help me stay balanced.

Early on, I tried TiddlyWiki several times, but I was initially put off by its save mechanism and markup editing. That changed when I discovered an auto-backup script, which gave me the confidence to fully commit. Over time, I improved the script and eventually transitioned to using TidGi-Desktop and TidGi-Mobile.

Today, my TiddlyWiki holds all my game design ideas and progress logs—it has truly become my second brain. With the help of LLM-powered programming tools, I’ve enhanced it with numerous plugins, allowing me to manage my mind in a more programmable and structured way. As a game developer, TiddlyWiki isn't the core of my professional work; But I've invested so much time because it's fundamentally about upgrading my mind.

Most of my notes are open by default and shared publicly on my homepage as a digital garden.
