The Newsletter Team is responsible for producing the [[TiddlyWiki Newsletter]]. We would love to have your help if you would like to get involved.

! Audience

The newsletter is intended for TiddlyWiki end users who do not track all the discussions on https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/.

Coverage of developer topics such as JavaScript and intricate wikitext should be handled thoughtfully to avoid alienating the core audience of end users.

Subscribing to the newsletter is intended to give people confidence that they will not miss any important developments.
