title: HelloThere

This is a demo of TiddlyWiki5 incorporating a plugin for the [[highlight.js|https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js]] syntax highlighting library from Ivan Sagalaev.

! Usage

The HighlightExample tiddler shows how fenced code blocks can have a language specifier added to trigger highlighting.

! Installation

To add this plugin to your own TiddlyWiki5, just drag this link to the browser window:

[[$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/highlight]]

! Adding Themes

You can add themes from highlight.js by copying the CSS to a new tiddler and tagging it with [[$:/tags/stylesheet]]. The available themes can be found on GitHub:
