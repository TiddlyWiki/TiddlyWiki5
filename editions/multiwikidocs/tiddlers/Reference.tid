! Authentication & Authorization

!! Overview

Our application has transitioned from a conventional username/password authentication system to a more robust Authentication and Authorization implementation. This new system supports multiple user accounts, roles, permissions, and a comprehensive access control list.

!! Key Features

# Multiple User Accounts
# Role-based Access Control
# Granular Permissions
# Access Control List (ACL)

!! Application Access & Security

!!! Initial Setup
When you first launch the Multiwiki Server, it operates in an unauthenticated mode to facilitate initial configuration. During this initial state, the system creates a temporary anonymous administrator account. Upon accessing the landing page, you'll receive a prominent security warning with instructions to establish a permanent ADMIN account. It's crucial to create this account immediately to secure your installation.

!!! User Types and Permissions

!!!! Administrator (ADMIN)

* Full system access and configuration rights
* Can create, modify, and delete user accounts
* Manages role assignments and permissions
* Controls global system settings
* Can configure guest access policies
* Has complete control over all recipes and tiddlers

!!!! Regular Users
* Custom accounts created by administrators
* Permissions determined by assigned roles
* Access limited to specific recipes based on role permissions
* Can have READ and/or WRITE permissions

!!!! Guest Users
* Default anonymous access level
* No inherent permissions
* Can only access recipes without Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* Read/write capabilities configurable by ADMIN
* Useful for public wikis or documentation sites

!!! Access Control System

!!!! Recipe-Level Security
* Access control is implemented at the recipe level
* Each recipe can have its own Access Control List (ACL)
* Permissions are granular:
** READ: Allows viewing recipe contents
** WRITE: Allows modifications to recipe contents

!!!! Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Administrators can create custom roles
* Roles can be assigned specific READ/WRITE permissions
* Users inherit permissions from their assigned roles
* Multiple roles can be assigned to a single user
* Provides flexible and scalable access management

!!!! Permission Inheritance
* Users receive combined permissions from all assigned roles
* More permissive role takes precedence in conflicts
* Guest access is overridden by recipe ACLs
* System automatically enforces most restrictive access when conflicts occur

This security model allows for fine-grained control over content access while maintaining flexibility for both private and public wiki deployments.

!! User Management & Security Architecture

!!! User Account Management

Users can be administered through two interfaces:

# Web-based Administrative Interface
#* Accessible only to ADMIN users
#* Provides graphical interface for user operations
#* Real-time validation and feedback
# Command-line Interface (CLI) Tools
#* Suitable for automation and scripting
#* Enables batch operations
#* Useful for system initialization

Each user account contains the following essential components:

* ''Username''
** Must be unique across the system
** Case-sensitive
** Used for authentication and audit trails
* ''Password''
** Stored using secure hashing algorithms
** Never stored in plaintext
** Subject to complexity requirements
* ''Role Assignments''
** Multiple roles can be assigned
** Inherited permissions from all assigned roles
** Dynamic permission calculation based on role combination

!!! Role & Permission Framework

!!!! Role Management

Roles serve as permission containers and provide organized access control. The system includes:

Built-in Roles:

* `ADMIN`
** Highest privilege level
** Full system access
** Cannot be modified or deleted
** Can create and manage other roles
** Controls guest access policies

* `USER`
** Basic access rights
** Typically limited to specific recipes
  
**Custom Roles (Examples):**

* `MANAGER`
** Intermediate access level
** Can manage subset of resources
** Custom roles as needed for specific use cases

!!!! Permission Architecture

Core Permissions:

* `READ` Permission
** View recipe contents
** Access tiddler data
** View metadata
** Export capabilities

* `WRITE` Permission
** Create new tiddlers
** Modify existing content
** Delete resources
** Manage recipe contents

**Guest Access:**

* No default permissions
* Access limited to non-ACL recipes
* Configurable by ADMIN users
* Suitable for public wikis

!!! Access Control List (ACL) Implementation

The ACL system provides granular security control through:

!!!! Entity-Level Control

* Recipe-based access control
* Individual resource protection
* Hierarchical permission inheritance

!!! Authentication Process Flow

* Initial Authentication
** User submits credentials
** System validates username existence
** Password hash comparison
** Session token generation

* Session Management
** Secure session storage
** Token-based authentication
** Automatic session expiration
** Re-authentication requirements

!!! Authorization Workflow

* Request Processing
** Capture user action request
** Identify target resource
** Extract required permissions

* Permission Validation
** Check user roles
** Aggregate permissions
** Verify ACL entries
** Apply guest policies if applicable

* Access Decision
** Compare required vs. available permissions
** Apply most restrictive policy
** Return access decision

!!! System Extension Guidelines

!!!! Adding New Roles

# Access administrative interface
# Define role identifier
# Assign base permissions
# Configure ACL mappings
# Test role functionality

!!!! Permission Expansion

# Define new permission type
# Update ACL structure
# Implement permission checks
# Update validation logic
# Document new permission

!!!! Security Considerations

* Regular permission audits
* Role assignment reviews
* Guest access monitoring
* Security log analysis
* Access pattern monitoring

This comprehensive security model provides flexible, maintainable, and secure access control while supporting both authenticated and guest users within the Multiwiki Server environment.

! HTTP API

The ~MultiWikiServer HTTP API provides access to resources hosted by the MWS store. It is based on [[the API of TiddlyWeb|https://tank.peermore.com/tanks/tiddlyweb/HTTP%20API]], first developed in 2008 by Chris Dent.

The design goals of the API are:

* To follow the principles of REST where practical
* To present resources as nouns, not verbs

General points about the design:

* In MWS there are no resources that end with / (except for the root path which is /)
