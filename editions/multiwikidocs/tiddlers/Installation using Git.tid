These instructions require basic knowledge both of the terminal and of Git. There are also [[alternative instructions without using Git|Installation]].

# Clone the code from GitHub with: <<.copy-code-to-clipboard "git clone -b multi-wiki-support --single-branch https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5">>
# Open a terminal window and set the current directory to the root of the downloaded folder
# Install the dependencies with the command: <<.copy-code-to-clipboard "npm install">>
# Start the server with the command: <<.copy-code-to-clipboard "npm start">>
# To use MWS, visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser on the same computer
# When you have finished using MWS, stop the server with <kbd>ctrl-C</kbd>

See [[Troubleshooting]] if you encounter any errors.

To update your copy of MWS with newer changes from ~GitHub, run the following command:

<<.copy-code-to-clipboard "git pull">>
