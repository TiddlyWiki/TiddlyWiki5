The Moon is [[Earth]]'s only natural satellite. We usually see it in the night sky and also during the day. Some other planets also have moons or natural satellites.

Our moon is about one-fourth of the width of the [[Earth]]. Because it is far away it looks small, about half a degree wide. The gravity on the moon is one-sixth of the [[Earth]]'s gravity. It means that something will be one-sixth as heavy on the Moon than on [[Earth]]. The Moon is a rocky and dusty place. It moves slowly away from the [[Earth]] at a rate of 3.8 cm per year, due to the effect of tidal dissipation.
