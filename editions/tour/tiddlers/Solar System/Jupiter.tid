Jupiter is the largest planet in the [[Solar System]]. It is the fifth planet from the [[Sun]]. Jupiter is a gas giant because it is so large, and made mostly of gas. The other gas giants in the Solar System are [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].

Jupiter's mass is about 318 times the mass of [[Earth]]. This is more than twice the mass of all the other planets in the [[Solar System]] put together.

Jupiter can be seen even without using a telescope. It is the third brightest object in the night sky. Only the [[Earth's Moon]] and [[Venus]] are brighter. The ancient Romans named the planet after their King of the Gods, Jupiter (Latin: Iuppiter).

Jupiter has 95 known moons. About 75 of them are very smallâ€”less than five kilometres wide. The four largest moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are called the Galilean moons because Galileo Galilei discovered them. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. Its diameter is larger than that of the planet [[Mercury]].
