Mars is the fourth planet from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]] and the second-smallest planet. Mars is a terrestrial planet with polar ice caps of frozen water and carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano in the [[Solar System]], and some very large impact craters. Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it appears of red color.

Space probes such as the Viking program landers are the main tools for the exploration of Mars.
