The Solar System is the [[Sun]] and all the objects that orbit around it. The Sun is orbited by [[planets|Planet]], [[asteroids|Asteroid]], [[comets|Comet]] and other things.

The Solar System is about 4.568 billion years old. The Sun formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud. It is mainly hydrogen, which it converts into helium through nuclear fusion. The planets are in a flattened orbiting disk. This disk was left over from the cloud that formed the Sun. Eventually, the gas and dust of the disk came together into planets. It is thought that almost all stars and their planets form this way.

The Sun is a star. It makes up 99.9% of the Solar System's mass. This means that it has strong gravity. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen, and some helium and higher elements. All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the Sun's mass. Oxygen is about 1% of the Sun's mass. Iron (0.2%) is the most plentiful of the other elements.

There are eight planets in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: [[Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas.

Six of the planets, and the six largest dwarf planets, are orbited by [[moons|Moon]]. There are more than 200 moons in the Solar System. [[Mercury]] and [[Venus]] have no moons, and [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have the largest number of moons. The largest moon is [[Ganymede]] which is a moon of [[Jupiter]]. [[Titan]] is one of [[Saturn]]â€™s moons. It is the only moon in the Solar System to have an atmosphere, which is mainly composed of nitrogen.

The Solar System also contains other things. There are [[asteroid belts|Asteroid]], mostly between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Further out than [[Neptune]], there is the [[Kuiper belt]] and the scattered disc. These areas have dwarf planets, including [[Pluto]], Makemake, Haumea, Ceres and Eris. There are thousands of very small objects in these areas. There are also [[comets|Comet]], centaurs, and interplanetary dust.
