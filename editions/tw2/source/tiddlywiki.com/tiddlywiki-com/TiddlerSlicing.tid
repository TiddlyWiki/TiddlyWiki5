TiddlerSlicing allows you to use special notation to pull out a chunk of specially marked text from within a tiddler. Each slice has a name and a value which can be specified anywhere within a tiddler in any of these formats:
{{{
    theName:  textSlice
    |theName:| textSlice |
    |theName| textSlice |
}}}
The name may contain any of the characters "a-ZA-Z_0-9", and may also be decorated with {{{''}}} or {{{//}}} markers for ''bold'' and //italic// formatting that are ignored. For example:
{{{
    |''theName:''| textSlice |
}}}
Slices can be then be referenced by qualifying the parent tiddler name with the symbols "::" and the name of the slice. For example:
{{{
ColorPalette::PrimaryLight
}}}
TiddlerSlicing doesn't work eveywhere; at this point it is mainly intended to support the ColorPalette and similar usages.

Finally, here's an example of some more complex slice formatting:
{{{

The slices defined in that example are:
