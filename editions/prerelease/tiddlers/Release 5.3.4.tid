! Major Improvements

!! Tour Plugin

<<.link-badge-added "https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/7734">> several new features that together allow interactive learning tours to be created and presented in TiddlyWiki.

The demo TiddlyWiki interactive tour can be seen at https://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/tour

The new features include:

* The new Tour Plugin itself
* The new Confetti Plugin that allows animated bursts of confetti to be displayed
* Improvements to the Dynannotate Plugin to add the ability to highlight screen elements using an animated spotlight effect

!! Geospatial Plugin

<<.link-badge-added "https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/7406">> new Geospatial Plugin that adds new primitives to the TiddlyWiki platform to enable non-developers to build sophisticated interactive geospatial applications.

The Geospatial Plugin incorporates a number of third party libraries and online services:

* [[Leaflet.js|https://leafletjs.com/]], an open source library to display interactive maps
* [[Turf.js|https://turfjs.org/]], an open source library to perform geospatial calculations with [[GeoJSON|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON]] objects
* [[TravelTime|https://traveltime.com/]], a commercial API for [[geocoding|https://traveltime.com/features/geocoding]], [[routing|https://traveltime.com/features/multi-modal-routing]] and [[isochrones|https://traveltime.com/features/isochrones]]
* [[Flickr|https://www.flickr.com/services/api/]], a free API for retrieving geotagged photographs
* [[OpenLocationCode|https://github.com/google/open-location-code]], Google's open source library for converting to and from Open Location Codes (also known as [[PlusCodes|https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/]])

!! <<.wlink TestCaseWidget>> Widget

<<.link-badge-added "https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/7817">> new <<.wlink TestCaseWidget>> widget that is intended to solve a problem with the examples that we feature in the documentation. The existing macros are workable for simple, self-contained examples, but can be hard to follow in cases where the examples use additional tiddlers. The <<.wlink TestCaseWidget>> widget displays complete, self-contained interactive examples showing the output together with a tabbed display of the constituent tiddlers that produce it:

<<testcase "TestCases/TestCaseWidget/TwoPlusTwo">>

The payload tiddlers for a test case are specified with the <<.wlink DataWidget>> widget. Test cases are run as an independent, self-contained nested wiki in a similar way to the [[Innerwiki Plugin]], but are much more lightweight. The disadvantage is that test cases are rendered as part of the main page, and so any styling changes will leak out to the rest of the page.

Test cases can also specify the raw HTML of the expected result which causes them to be executed as tests, with success or failure indicated by an icon:

<<testcase "TestCases/TestCaseWidget/FailingTest">>

The easiest way to use the <<.wlink TestCaseWidget>> is by creating TestCaseTiddlers using the new CompoundTiddlers format. There are also many test cases to view in the TiddlyWiki test edition at https://tiddlywiki.com/prerelease/test.html

! Translation improvements

<<.link-badge-extended "https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/7821">> the [[lingo Macro]] so that plugins can be translated in a similar way to the core. The menubar and tiddlyweb plugins have been updated to use the new mechanism, and we welcome pull requests to convert more of the core plugins to the new mechanism.

This release also includes improvements to the following translations:

* Chinese
* French
* Macedonian
* Polish

! Plugin Improvements

* <<.link-badge-added "https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/8198">> badges to the core plugins to indicate their [[stability level|Plugin Stability]] from "deprecated", "experimental", "stable" and "legacy". These badges are shown in the plugin library and in the control panel
