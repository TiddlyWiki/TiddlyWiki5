title: How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file with encryption

[[TiddlyWiki5 Standalone Edition]] allows content to be encrypted using the [[Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library]].

# Switch to the ''Tools'' tab in the sidebar and look for the words //This wiki is not encrypted// and a button labelled ''Set password''
# Click ''Set password''
# Type a password and click the ''Set'' button (or use the enter key)
# The control panel should now say //This wiki is encrypted// with buttons for changing and clearing the password
# Save the wiki using the button in the sidebar
# Optionally, open the saved file in a text editor and verify that your data is encrypted
