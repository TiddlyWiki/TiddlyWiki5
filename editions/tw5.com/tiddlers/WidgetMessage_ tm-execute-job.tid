<<.from-version "5.1.18">> The "execute job" message triggers the execution of [[remote commands|Using remote commands]]. It uses the message parameters as follows:

|!Name |!Description |
|$param |Not used |
|commands |Command string to be executed |
|0...n |Command tokens to be executed |
|statusTitle |Optional title of tiddler in which to store status updates as the commands are executed |

Note that the command string to be executed can either be passed as a single string, or as a sequence of tokens:

* A single string:
*> `<$action-sendmessage $message="tm-execute-job" commands="--version"/>`
* Separate command tokens with numeric indices:
*> `<$action-sendmessage $message="tm-execute-job" 0="--version" 1="--version"/>`
** Note that the numeric indices must be non-negative integers with no leading zeros

The "execute job" message is handled by the TiddlyWiki core SyncMechanism which invokes the current [[SyncAdaptorModule|SyncAdaptorModules]] (typically the ''tiddlywiki/tiddlywebadaptor'' plugin).
