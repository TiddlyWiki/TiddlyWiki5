# Visit http://five.tiddlywiki.com/empty.html
# Drag your old TiddlyWiki5 HTML file into the browser window
#* Your tiddlers should be imported
# Save changes to save the new version

//For the moment you'll also need to manually update any plugins that are not included in empty.html://

># Open the control panel to the ''Plugins'' tab in your upgraded wiki
># Check the version numbers of the plugins you are using; any plugins with an older version than the version of [[$:/core]] will probably need updating
># Locate a wiki with the plugins you need to update and open the control panel ''Plugins'' tab
