title: TaskManagementExample
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

TiddlyWiki5 can be used as a simple task management system without further customisation. The idea is that tasks be tagged `task`, with those that are completed also tagged `done`. In this way it is straightforward to generate task lists.

<<.tip """There is [[an enhanced version of this demo|TaskManagementExample (Draggable)]] that adds the ability to drag and drop the tasks to re-order them.""">>

! Outstanding tasks

<$list filter="[!has[draft.of]tag[task]!tag[done]sort[created]]">

<$checkbox tag="done"> <$link/></$checkbox>

</$list>

! Completed tasks

<$list filter="[!has[draft.of]tag[task]tag[done]sort[created]]">

<$checkbox tag="done"> ~~<$link/>~~</$checkbox>

</$list>
