Test case tiddlers encapsulate one or more tiddlers that can be displayed as a [[test case|TestCaseWidget]]: an independent embedded wiki that can be used for testing or learning purposes.

Test case tiddlers are formatted as CompoundTiddlers, allowing them to contain multiple tiddlers packed into one.

Test case tiddlers have the following fields:

|!Field |!Description |
|<<.field type>> | Should be set to `text/vnd.tiddlywiki-multiple` |
|<<.field tags>> | Test cases are tagged [[$:/tags/wiki-test-spec]]. Test cases that intentionally fail are tagged [[$:/tags/wiki-test-spec-failing]] |
|<<.field description>> |Descriptive heading for the test, intended to make it easy to identify the test |
|<<.field display-format>> |Optional, defaults to `wikitext`. Set to `plaintext` to cause the output to be rended as plain text |

Test case tiddlers with the appropriate tag are shown in $:/ControlPanel

Some payload tiddlers are set aside for special purposes:

|!Tiddler |!Description |
|''Narrative'' |Narrative description of the test, intended to explain the purpose and operation of the test |
|''Output'' |The tiddler that produces the test output |
|''~ExpectedResult'' |HTML of expected result of rendering the ''Output'' tiddler |
