When ~TiddlyWiki generates a list of the tiddlers that have a particular tag (e.g. the dropdown list of a tag pill), it orders the tiddlers using the following rules:

# Start with any that are [[declared|Title List]] in the <<.field list>> field of the tag tiddler, in the order given there.

# In each remaining tiddler <<.place T>>, look for a <<.field list-before>> field. If this has a tiddler title as its value, place <<.place T>> just <<.em before>> that one.
#* As a special case, if the field exists but its value is empty, place <<.place T>> at the very start of the list.

# In each remaining tiddler <<.place T>>, look for a <<.field list-after>> field. If this has a tiddler title as its value, place tiddler <<.place T>> just <<.em after>> that one.

#* As a special case, if the field exists but its value is empty, place <<.place T>> at the very end of the list.

# If any tiddlers still remain, place them at the end of the list in ascending alphabetical order of title. The difference between capital and lowercase letters is ignored.

The ordering of tiddlers with a particular tag can be directly modified using drag and drop within a tag pill dropdown. The underlying [[list-tagged-draggable Macro]] can also be used elsewhere.
