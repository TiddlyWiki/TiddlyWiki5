Compound tiddlers are a special type of tiddler that can store one or more payload tiddlers. The tiddlers within a compound tiddler are only accessible via special operations, typically with the TestCaseWidget.

The compound tiddler format is extremely simple, and includes the notable flaw that it does not permit tiddlers that contain a plus sign (`+`) on a line by itself. It is not intended as a general purpose way of storing tiddler data.

Compound tiddlers are identified by having their type field set to `text/vnd.tiddlywiki-multiple`.

The content of a compound tiddler consists of a sequence of tiddlers separated by a plus sign (`+`) on a line by itself. Each tiddler uses the same format as [[.tid files|TiddlerFiles]].

For example:

```
title: First
tags: one two

This is the first tiddler
+
title: Second
tags: three four

This is the second tiddler
+
title: third
tags: five six

This is the third tiddler
```
