~WikiText is a concise, expressive way of typing a wide range of text formatting, hypertext and interactive features. It allows you to focus on writing without a complex user interface getting in the way. It is designed to be familiar for users of [[Markdown]] but with more of a focus on linking and the interactive features.

~WikiText can also be inserted to the text field using the [[Editor toolbar]] buttons.

See [[Formatting in WikiText]] and [[Formatting text in TiddlyWiki]] for an introduction to ~WikiText.

The following elements of ~WikiText syntax are built into the core:

<<list-links filter:"[tag[WikiText]]" class:"multi-columns">>
