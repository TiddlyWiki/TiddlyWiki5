title: Temporary Tiddlers

Temporary tiddlers are tiddlers that will be discarded when TiddlyWiki is saved. Under default configuration of the SavingMechanism (more specifically, the filter in [[$:/core/save/all]]), these are tiddlers prefixed with `$:/temp/`. This prefix makes them SystemTiddlers as well.

One example usage of temporary tiddlers is storing the search queries. The query typed in the [[$:/AdvancedSearch]] is stored in [[$:/temp/advancedsearch]].
