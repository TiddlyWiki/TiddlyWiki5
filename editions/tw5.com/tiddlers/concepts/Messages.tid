Widget [[messages|Core Messages]] are generated by [[Widgets]] in response to user actions.  Messages have a name, an optional primary parameter <<.param param>> and one or more optional named parameters. These messages travel up the widget tree where they are handled by ancestor widgets or the Core itself.

For messages used by the TiddlyWiki Core see [[Core Messages]]
