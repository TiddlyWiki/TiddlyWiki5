The following substitutions are made:

|!Character |!Replacement |!Condition |
|`\` |`\\` |Always |
|`"` |`\"` |Always |
|`'` |`\'` |Always |
|Line feed (0x0a) |`\n` |Always |
|Carriage return (0x0d) |`\r` |Always |
|Characters from 0x00 to 0x1f, except listed above |`\x##` where ## is two hex digits |Always |
|Characters from 0x80 to 0xffff|`\u####` where #### is four hex digits |If `rawunicode` suffix is not present (default) |
|Characters from 0x80 to 0xffff|<<.from-version "5.1.23">> Unchanged |If `rawunicode` suffix is present |

<<.from-version "5.1.23">> If the suffix `rawunicode` is present, Unicode characters above 0x80 (such as ÃŸ, Ã¤, Ã± or ðŸŽ„) will be passed through unchanged. Without the suffix, they will be substituted with `\u` codes, which was the default behavior before 5.1.23. Characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, such as ðŸŽ„ and other emojis, will be encoded as a UTF-16 surrogate pair, i.e. with two `\u` sequences.

<<.note """Mind the differences compared to <<.olink jsonstringify>> in encoding of single quotes and control characters (0x00 to 0x1f).
