title: title Operator
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
caption: title
op-purpose: select a single title
op-input: ignored
op-neg-input: a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]
op-parameter: a tiddler title
op-parameter-name: T
op-output: a selection containing only <<.place T>>
op-neg-output: the input, but with tiddler <<.place T>> filtered out if it exists in the wiki

`[title[An Example]]` can be shortened to `[[An Example]]`, because <<.op title>> is the default filter operator. Consequentially, `[!title[An Example]]` can be shortened to `[![An Example]]`.

<<.op title>> is a [[constructor|Selection Constructors]] (except in the form `!title`), but <<.olink2 "field:title" field>> is a [[modifier|Selection Constructors]].

<<.from-version "5.3.7">> If the operand is quoted with round brackets then the <<.op title>> operator returns the complete list of titles assigned to the multi-valued variable. When negated, the title operator with multi-valued operands returns all the titles that are not present in the operand list.

<<.operator-examples "title">>
