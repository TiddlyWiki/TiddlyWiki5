caption: colour-set-oklch
op-purpose: manipulate colour values in the OKLCH colour space
op-input: a selection of colour values
op-suffix: "l", "c" or "h" to indicate which component of the colour to modify
op-parameter: value of the property to modify
op-output: the values of the modified colours

<<.from-version "5.3.7">> See [[Colour Palettes]] for background.

The <<.op colour-set-oklch>> operator is used to manipulate colour values in the [[OKLCH|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch]] colour space. The OKLCH colour space expresses colours as three numbers:

|!Id |!Name |!Range |
|l |Lightness |0 – 1 |
|c |Chroma |0 – 0.4 |
|h |Hue |0 – 360 |

The advantage of the OKLCH space is that it is perceptually uniform, meaning that equal changes in the numbers correspond to equal changes in the perceived colour.

For example, this filter expression will alter the lightness of the current page background colour to 0.1:

```
[function[colour],[page-background]colour-set-oklch:l[0.1]]
```

See also the following related operators:

* <<.olink colour-get-oklch>> to retrieve a component of a colour value in the OKLCH colour space
* <<.olink colour-lighten>> to lighten a colour value
* <<.olink colour-darken>> to lighten a colour value
