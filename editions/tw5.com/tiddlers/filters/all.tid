op-input: ignored, unless the parameter is empty
op-output: the titles that belong to all the specified categories
op-parameter: zero or more categories
op-purpose: find all titles of a fundamental category
tags: [[Filter Operators]] [[Common Operators]] [[Selection Constructors]] [[Selection Constructors: Conditional]]
title: all Operator
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The parameter specifies zero or more fundamental categories using the following [[filter step|Filter Step]] syntax:

<$railroad text="""
\start none
\end none
<-"all"->  (  "[" | "<" | "{"  )
   [{: ("current" | "missing" |: "orphans" | "shadows" | "tags" | "tiddlers" ) +"+" }] 
   (  "]" | ">" | "}"  )
"""/>

|!Category |!Members |!Sorted |
|^`current` |just the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]] |^-- |
|^`missing` |all non-existent tiddlers to which there is at least one [[hard link|Hard and Soft Links]] |^no |
|^`orphans` |all tiddlers to which there are <<.em no>> hard links |^by title |
|^`shadows` |all the [[shadow tiddlers|ShadowTiddlers]] that exist, including any that have been overridden with non-shadow tiddlers |^no |
|^`tags` |all the tags in use on non-shadow tiddlers |no |
|^`tiddlers` |all the non-shadow tiddlers that exist |no |

If the parameter specifies more than one category, they are processed from left to right. The overall output is initially empty, and each category's output is [[dominantly appended|Dominant Append]] to it in turn. Unrecognised categories contribute nothing to the output.

As a special case, if the parameter is empty, the output is simply a copy of the input. This can be useful when the parameter is a [[soft parameter|Filter Parameter]].

The <<.olink is>> operator is similar, but its scope is restricted to its input.
