The input titles from previous runs are made available to this run as numeric variables <<.var $1>>, <<.var $2>>, <<.var $3>> etc. The results of the filter run are the output titles.

The `:apply` filter run prefix is useful when using computed values as the parameters of operators. For example:

```
=[<first>addsuffix<s>] =[<second>addsuffix<s>] :apply[function[process],<$1>,<$2>]
```
