type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The ''sortcs'' filter operator sorts the current list case sensitively (upper and lower case letters are considered different), along the field specified in the operand (which defaults to `title`). Preceding the operator with `!` reverses the sort order.

For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`one two Three four +[sortcs[]]` |Returns `Three`, `four`, `one`, `two` |
