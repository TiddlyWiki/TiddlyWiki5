type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The ''search'' filter operator filters the current list to leave only those tiddlers that include the operand text in their title, body or tags. Preceding the operator with `!` returns all tiddlers that do not include the specified text. The search is case-insenstive.

For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`[search[alsatian]]` |Returns a list of the tiddlers containing the text "alsatian" |
|`[all[shadows]search[alsatian]]` |Returns a list of the shadow tiddlers containing the text "alsatian" |
