type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
caption: search
purpose: filter the input by searching tiddler content

<$macrocall $name=".operator-def"
input="a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]"
suffix="optionally, the name of a [[field|TiddlerFields]]"
suffixName="f"
parameter="one or more search terms, separated by spaces"
output="those input tiddlers in which <<.em all>> of the search terms can be found in the value of field <<.place f>>"
negationOutput="those input tiddlers in which <<.em not>> all of the search terms can be so found"
/>

When used with a suffix, the <<.op search>> operator is similar to <<.olink regexp>> but less powerful.

If the suffix is omitted, a tiddler is deemed to match if all the search terms appear in the combination of its <<.field tags>>, <<.field text>> and <<.field title>> fields.

The search ignores the difference between capital and lowercase letters.
