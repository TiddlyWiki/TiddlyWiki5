<<.from-version "5.2.2">>

The <<.op removeprefix>> operator uses an extended syntax that permits multiple flags to be passed:

```
[removeprefix:<flag list>[<parameter>]]
```

* ''flag list'': a comma delimited list of flags

The available flags are:

* ''casesensitive'': (default), this flag forces a case-sensitive match, where upper and lower case letters are considered different
* ''caseinsensitive'': overrides the default so that upper and lower case letters are considered identical for matching purposes
