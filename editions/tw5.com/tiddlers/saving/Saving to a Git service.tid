TiddlyWiki can save changes directly to a GitHub repository in the single file configuration.

Saving to a Git service is configured in the [[$:/ControlPanel]] in the ''Git Service Saver'' tab under the ''Saving'' tab. The following settings are supported:

* ''Type'' - (mandatory) the type of the service (e.g. GitHub, GitLab)
* ''Username'' - (mandatory) the username for the Git service account used for saving changes
* ''Password'' - (mandatory) the OAUTH token or personal access token for the specified account. Note that GitHub deprecated password authentication, permitted authentication methods are shown in the [[API documentation|https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication]].
* ''Repository'' - (mandatory) the name of the Git repository. Both the owner name and the repository name must be specified. For example `Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5`
* ''Branch'' - (optional) the name of the branch to be used within the Git repository. Defaults to `main` (~GitHub) or `master` (~GitLab)"
* ''Path'' - (optional) the path to the target file. Defaults to `/`
* ''Filename'' - (mandatory) the filename of the target file

Notes

* The Git service token or password is stored persistently in browser local storage. Be sure to clear the password if using a shared machine. Using a personal access token for authentication offers an extra layer of security: if the access token is accidentally exposed it can be revoked without needing to reset the account password
