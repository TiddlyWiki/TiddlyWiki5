The iPad/iPhone app ''Quine 2'' makes it possible to view, edit and then save changes to TiddlyWiki5 on iOS. [[Download it here|https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quine-2/id1450128957]].

Instructions for use:

# Open Quine 2
# Tap the + toolbar button to create and open a new TiddlyWiki
# From the file list tap an existing TiddlyWiki file to open it
# Edit the TiddlyWiki as normal, and save as normal using either Autosave or the TiddlyWiki save button <<.icon $:/core/images/save-button-dynamic>>
# Tap the left hand "Documents" toolbar button to close an open TiddlyWiki

*Quine 2 works natively in iOS with the local file system and the iCloud file system
*Quine 2 also allows you to open, edit and save TiddlyWiki files stored with cloud file providers
*Quine 2 allows you to follow embedded WikiText links and canonical links to external files for cloud-like file providers which support "folder level sharing". 
**This includes the apps "Secure Shellfish" and "Working Copy". Most providers, though, do not allow apps like Quine 2 to access linked files this way.
** If you wish to enable such links for "well behaved" file providers, toggle "on" the "Enable folder selection for out-of-sandbox links" setting in iOS Settings for Quine 2

//Note that Quine is published independently of TiddlyWiki//
