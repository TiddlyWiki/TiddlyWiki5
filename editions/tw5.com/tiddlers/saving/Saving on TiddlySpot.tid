[[TiddlySpot.com|http://tiddlyspot.com]] is a hosting service for TiddlyWiki created in 2006 by Simon Baird and Daniel Baird.

In early 2021 it was superseded by [[TiddlyHost|Saving on TiddlyHost]], a new, secure, modern reimagining of ~TiddlySpot. Creating new sites on ~TiddlySpot is no longer supported, (though sites created in 2020 or earlier are still functional).

!! Security warning for ~TiddlySpot

Note that your password is sent unencrypted when using ~TiddlySpot. From the [[FAQ|http://faq.tiddlyspot.com/]]:

<<<
''Is Tiddlyspot secure?''

No. Tiddlyspot does not use SSL/https, so all ~TiddlySpot web traffic is vulnerable to packet sniffing. This means your password and site data could be intercepted by a malicious third party. For this reason, please don't keep sensitive information in your ~TiddlySpot site, and don't use a password that you use for other web sites.

!! Problems with saving on ~TiddlySpot

In case you run into this error when uploading a freshly upgraded local TiddlyWiki to ~TiddlySpot:

<<<
Error: NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI: Access to restricted URI denied
<<<

The upgrade operation falls foul of a security restriction in Firefox. Until this can be resolved, we suggest using Chrome.

* Use Chrome to open the local TiddlyWiki document you want to upload to ~TiddlySpot and follow the steps 1 through 5 described at [[Upgrading]].
* Once you've checked the ~TiddlySpot-hosted TiddlyWiki loads properly in Chrome, you should be able to access, edit and [[save using TiddlyFox|Saving with TiddlyFox]] again.
* After you've uploaded your local document once, further editing and saving of the online version hosted on ~TiddlySpot should work with any modern browser of your choice. (Don't forget to fill in the ~TiddlySpot password in your ~TiddlySpot TiddlyWiki control panel for any new browser you want to use for saving changes.)
