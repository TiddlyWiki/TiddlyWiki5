A local mini binary server for TiddlyWiki5 that saves and backups wikis and uploads files for TiddlyWiki, inspired by
[[tw5-server.rb | https://gist.github.com/jimfoltz/ee791c1bdd30ce137bc23cce826096da]].

tw5server provides features of:

* Server for TiddlyWiki5, as well as other files (e.g. images used in TW5 `[img[images/*.png]]`);
* Easy to save wiki via browsers;
* Backup wiki in compress format (.gz), to save disk space;
* Auto clean backups: keep one newest per previous month, keep all backups in current month.
* Upload files/images to server via pressing button or drag-and-drop, for use in tiddlywiki as external links.
* Offer binary executable for Linux, macos, Android and windows.

Download executable binary at the github.com [[tw5-server|https://github.com/hffqyd/tw5-server]].
