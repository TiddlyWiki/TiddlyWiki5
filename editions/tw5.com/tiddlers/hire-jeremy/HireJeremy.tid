<$expand.able heading="Ways to collaborate">

Projects begin as a conversation with the client to understand the vision, goals and operating context. One or more roof-of-concept prototypes are followed by iterative, timeboxed development cycles. We meet regularly to review progress and agree next steps.

Most of my projects have grown into long-term collaborations, but I also take on smaller, focused engagements. I work across several projects at once, identifying common needs and building components that benefit multiple clients, and often become enhancements for the whole ~TiddlyWiki community.

I've been lucky enough to work on some meaningful and interesting projects with a wide range of organisations from across the globe. Notably:

* For a charity - [[Xememex]], a multi-user ~TiddlyWiki server with thousands of users
* For a philanthropic investment firm - an extranet to share their pipeline with external partners
* For a law firm - a hypertext knowledge system with hundreds of thousands of densely linked tiddlers
* For a publisher - an experimental hypertext book publishing platform
* For a real estate firm - a new geospatial plugin
