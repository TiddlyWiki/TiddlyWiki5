title: Copying tiddlers between TiddlyWiki files
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can copy an individual tiddler from one TiddlyWiki file to another by dragging a link to the tiddler from one browser window to another.

If you want to drag a link, first move it vertically, because horizontal movement is recognized by the browser as text selection.
