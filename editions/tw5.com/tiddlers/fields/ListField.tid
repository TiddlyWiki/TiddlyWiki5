The `list` [[field of a tiddler|TiddlerFields]] is an optional feature that can be used to help structure your content. Its value is a [[title list|Title List]], and it can be used in several ways:

* The `list` field of a tiddler that is being used as a tag determines the ordering of the tiddlers that carry that tag - see [[Tagging]] for details
* The `list` [[filter|Filters]] selects the entries from a list
* The `listed` [[filter|Filters]] selects the tiddlers that list the selected tiddler(s)
* The NavigatorWidget manipulates a [[StoryList|$:/StoryList]] tiddler containing a `list` field of the tiddlers that are displayed in the main story column
