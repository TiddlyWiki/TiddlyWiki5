~TiddlyWiki provides several macros for generating a tree of tiddler links by analysing [[tags|Tagging]]:

;<<.var toc>>
: A simple tree
;<<.var toc-expandable>>
: A tree in which all the branches can be expanded and collapsed
;<<.var toc-selective-expandable>>
: A tree in which the non-empty branches can be expanded and collapsed
;<<.var toc-tabbed-internal-nav>> and <<.var toc-tabbed-external-nav>>
: A two-panel browser:
:* on the left, a selectively expandable tree that behaves like a set of vertical tabs
:* on the right, the content of whichever tiddler the user selects in the tree

The difference between the last two has to do with what happens when the user clicks a link in the right-hand panel:

;<<.var toc-tabbed-internal-nav>>
: The target tiddler appears in the right-hand panel, replacing the tiddler that contained the link
;<<.var toc-tabbed-external-nav>>
: The target tiddler appears in the normal way (which depends on the user's configured storyview)

!! Structure

The top level of the tree consists of the tiddlers that carry a particular tag, known as the <<.def "root tag">>. Tiddlers tagged with any of those make up the next level down, and so on.

At each level, the tiddlers can be [[ordered|Order of Tagged Tiddlers]] by means of the <<.field list>> field of the parent tag tiddler. They can also be ordered by the macro's <<.param sort>> parameter.

The tree displays the <<.field caption>> field of a tiddler if it has one, or the tiddler's title otherwise.

Each tiddler in the tree is normally displayed as a link. To suppress this, give the tiddler a <<.field toc-link>> field with the the value <<.value no>>. In the [[examples|Table-of-Contents Macros (Examples)]], the SecondThree tiddler is set up like this. Clicking such a tiddler in the tree causes its branch to expand or collapse.

<<.from-version "5.1.23">> By default, the links open the tiddlers making up the table of contents. Alternatively, if the tiddler contains a <<.field target>> field then its contents will be used as the target of the link.

The table of contents is generated as an HTML ordered list. The `<ol>` elements always have the class `tc-toc`. Expandable trees have the additional class `tc-toc-expandable`. Selectively expandable trees (including those in the two-panel browser) have `tc-toc-selective-expandable`.

To make a table of contents appear in the sidebar, see [[How to add a new tab to the sidebar]].

!! Parameters

;tag
: The root tag that identifies the top level of the tree
;sort
: An optional extra [[filter step|Filter Step]], e.g. `sort[title]`

These two parameters are combined into a single [[filter expression|Filter Expression]] like this:

> `[tag[$tag$]$sort$]`

<<.var toc-tabbed-internal-nav>> and <<.var toc-tabbed-external-nav>> take additional parameters:

;selectedTiddler
: The title of the [[state tiddler|StateMechanism]] for noting the currently selected tiddler, defaulting to `$:/temp/toc/selectedTiddler`. It is recommended that this be a [[system tiddler|SystemTiddlers]]
;unselectedText
: The text to display when no tiddler is selected in the tree
;missingText
: The text to display if the selected tiddler doesn't exist
;template
: Optionally, the title of a tiddler to use as a [[template|TemplateTiddlers]] for transcluding the selected tiddler into the right-hand panel
