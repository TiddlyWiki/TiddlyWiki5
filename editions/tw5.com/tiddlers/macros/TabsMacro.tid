title: TabsMacro
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The tabs macro displays a list of tiddlers as a tab control. The user can switch between tabs by clicking on them. The tabs are labelled with the title of the corresponding tiddler, unless there is a `caption` field present in which case it is used instead.

By default the tab control arranges the tabs horizontally with the content underneath. You can also choose to have the tabs arranged vertically by passing the class `tw-vertical`.

! Parameters

|!Position |!Name |!Description |!Default |
|1st |tabsList |Filter giving the tiddlers to be displayed | |
|2nd |default |Name of the tiddler containing the default tab | |
|3rd |state |String to distinguish multiple tabs within the same tiddler (use of the system tiddler prefix is recommended) |''$:/state/tab'' |
|4th |class |Additional CSS classes for the three wrappers DIV of the tab | |
|5th |template |Optional template through which to render the tab content | |

Within the template the title of the current tab is available in the widget variable ''currentTab''.
