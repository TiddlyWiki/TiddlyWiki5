----------

<<.preamble """What follows is a formal presentation of the syntax of the `\define` pragma, using [[railroad diagrams|Railroad Diagrams]]. A [[simpler overview|Macro Definitions in WikiText]] is also available.""">>

<$railroad text="""
"\define" space name params [:space] rest
"""/>

<<.place space>> denotes a sequence of [[whitespace characters|Filter Whitespace]].

The [[macro|Macros]]'s <<.place name>> is a sequence of non-whitespace characters other than `(` or `>`.

The parameter declaration list (<<.place params>>) has the following syntax:

<$railroad text="""
"(" [:sep] [:{ param sep }] ")"
"""/>

The parameter separator (<<.place sep>>) is any sequence of characters that does not match a <<.place param-name>>. Among other things, this includes commas, spaces and linefeeds.

A <<.place param-name>> is a sequence of letters (`A`--`Z`, `a`--`z`), digits (`0`--`9`), hyphens (`-`) and underscores (`_`).

Each individual <<.place param>> has the following syntax:

<$railroad text="""
param-name [: [:space] ":" [:space] default ]
")"
"""/>

The optional <<.place default>> value of a parameter is specified as follows:

<$railroad text={{$:/editions/tw5.com/railroad/macro-parameter-value}}/>

The <<.place rest>> of the definition has the following syntax:

<$railroad text="""
( snippet | lf snippet lf "\end" [:space] ) lf
"""/>

<<.place lf>> denotes a linefeed.

The <<.place snippet>> is any sequence of characters that doesn't terminate the macro definition. That is to say, a single-line snippet cannot contain a linefeed, and a multi-line snippet cannot contain `\end` on a line of its own.

The snippet can contain placeholders with the following syntax:

<$railroad text="""
( "$" name "$" | "$" "(" name ")" "$" )
"""/>
