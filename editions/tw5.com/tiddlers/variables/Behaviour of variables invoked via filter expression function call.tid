|\define, <<.wlink SetWidget>>, <<.wlink LetWidget>>, <<.wlink VarsWidget>>, \procedure, \widget|Every function is a variable, but only variables defined using \function are invokable using the <<.olink function>> filter operator. Attempts to use a non-function variable is the same as if the function doesn't exist. The behavior in this case is like the identity function. All filter input is passed unchanged to the output.|
|\function|The body text of the function is treated as a filter expression and evaluated. This filter expression can itself contain a function call. Filter expressions can be factored out into functions arbitrarily deep.|
