<<.from-version "5.3.0">> The <<.def thisTiddler>> [[variable|Variables]] is set by the <<.wlink TranscludeWidget>> widget to contain the title of the tiddler that was transcluded. This means that within transclusions <<.def thisTiddler>> will contain the title of the transcluded tiddler. It is not affected by macros, which means that within a macro <<.def thisTiddler>> will contain the title of the tiddler from which the macro was invoked. Intermediate, nested macro calls are ignored.

There are two key usages for <<.def thisTiddler>>:

* Within a transcluded template, <<.def thisTiddler>> points to the template itself, making it possible for the template to access data stored in other fields of the template
* Within a macro, <<.def thisTiddler>> points to the template that invoked the macro. If the macro was invoked by another macro, the template that invoked that macro is returned, and so on

Compare <<.vlink storyTiddler>> and <<.vlink currentTiddler>>.
