!! Introduction

<<.from-version "5.3.0">> A <<.def procedure>> is a named snippet of text. They are typically defined with the [[Pragma: \procedure]]:

```
\procedure my-procedure(parameter:"Default value")
This is the procedure, and the parameter is <<parameter>>.
\end
```

The name wrapped in double angled [[brackets|Brackets]] is a shorthand way of [[transcluding|Transclusion]] the snippet. Each of these <<.def "procedure calls">> can supply a different set of parameters:

```
<<my-procedure>>
<<my-procedure "The parameter">>
<<my-procedure parameter:"The parameter">>
```

The parameters that are specified in the procedure call are made available as variables.

<<.tip """If a procedure has more than one parameter, it is highly encouraged to use "named parameters", as shown in the third example above and in contrast to the second example. Even if it is more to type, it will pay off in the long run.""">>

!! How Procedures Work

Procedures are implemented as a special kind of [[variable|Variables]]. The only thing that distinguishes them from ordinary variables is the way that the parameters are handled.

!! Using Procedures

* [[Procedure Definitions]] describes how to create procedures
* [[Procedure Calls]] describes how to use procedures
* [[Procedure Parameter Handling]] describes how procedure parameters work
* [[Procedure Syntax]] is a formal syntax description using railroad diagrams
