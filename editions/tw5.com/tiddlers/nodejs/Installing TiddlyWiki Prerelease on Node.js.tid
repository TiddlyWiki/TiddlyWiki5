# Clone a local copy of the TiddlyWiki5 GitHub repository from https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5
# Open a command line terminal and change the current working directory to the root of the TiddlyWiki5 repo
# Type `npm link` (Windows) or `sudo npm link` (Mac/Linux) to tell [[npm]] to use this copy of the repo as the globally installed one
# Inside the root, you can launch ~TiddlyWiki like this:  <br/>``tiddlywiki editions/tw5.com-server --listen``

After this procedure you can work with TiddlyWiki5 via [[npm]] as though it had been installed in the usual way with `npm install -g tiddlywiki`.

Update the clone from time to time in order to ensure that you have the latest code.
