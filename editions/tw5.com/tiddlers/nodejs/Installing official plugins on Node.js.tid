title: Installing official plugins on Node.js
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Follow these instructions when using TiddlyWiki with a client-server Node.js configuration:

# Identify the plugins you want to install using the ''Plugins'' tab of <<controlPanel-plugin-link>> (''don't'' install the plugins from here, though)
#* Plugins are identified by their type (ie language, theme or plugin) and their publisher and title. For example, the plugin `$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/internals` is referred to as ''tiddlywiki/internals''

# Quit the server if it is running

# Edit the `tiddlywiki.info` file (it is in JSON format) and locate the `plugins`, `themes` or `languages` section (see below)

# Add entries corresponding to the plugins you wish to add
#* Take care to retain ''commas ''to separate items
#* Do ''not'' terminate the last item in a list with a comma

# Restart the server

```
