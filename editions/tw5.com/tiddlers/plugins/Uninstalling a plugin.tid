\rules except wikilink

If you want to follow the steps //side by side// you can <<open-tiddler-in-window>>.


Follow these instructions when using TiddlyWiki as a standalone, single file wiki.

# Create a backup of your current TiddlyWiki HTML file ([[just in case|The First Rule of Using TiddlyWiki]])

# Open the <<controlPanel-plugin-link>> and go to the ''Plugins'' tab

# Click on the plugin you want to delete to open it as a standalone tiddler

# Click the <<.icon $:/core/images/down-arrow>> ''more'' button and <<.icon $:/core/images/delete-button>> ''delete'' the tiddler

# Save your TiddlyWiki <<.icon $:/core/images/save-button-dynamic>>

# If a yellow warning bar appears at the top of the window,  refresh the window so that TiddlyWiki completely removes the plugin <<.icon $:/core/images/refresh-button>>

#* <<.from-version "5.1.22">> It is no longer necessary to refresh TiddlyWiki when deleting plugins that support dynamic loading. See [[PluginMechanism]] for more details

# The plugin should no longer be active or available
