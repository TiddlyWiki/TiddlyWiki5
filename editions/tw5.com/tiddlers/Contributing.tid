TiddlyWiki5 welcomes contributions to its code and documentation via [[GitHub|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5]]. Please take a moment to read these notes to help make the process as smooth as possible.

!! Bug Reports

From the perspective of a programmer, a bug report that just says "it doesn't work" is highly frustrating. For effective debugging, we need as much information as possible. At a minimum, please ensure that you include:

* A descriptive title
* A summary
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behaviour
* Context (OS, browser etc.)

There's a lot of good material on the web about bug reports:

* http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

!! Pull Requests

Like other OpenSource projects, TiddlyWiki5 needs a signed ContributorLicenseAgreement from individual contributors before contributions of code can be accepted. This is a legal agreement that allows contributors  to assert that they own the copyright of their contribution, and that they agree to license it to the UnaMesa Association (the legal entity that owns TiddlyWiki on behalf of the community).

* For individuals use: [[CLA-individual|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/tree/master/licenses/cla-individual.md]]
* For entities use: [[CLA-entity|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/tree/master/licenses/cla-entity.md]]

//This is a first pass at a CLA for TiddlyWiki. Please let us know if we missed something important. If we do have to make essential changes to the CLA, there is a possibility that all contributors will need to sign it again//

!!! How to sign the CLA

```
git clone https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5.git TiddlyWiki5
cd TiddlyWiki5
git checkout -b sign-cla
```

''Add your name and the date to cla-individual.md or cla-entity.md''. Date format (YYYY/MM/DD)
eg: `Jeremy Ruston, @Jermolene, 2011/11/22`

```
