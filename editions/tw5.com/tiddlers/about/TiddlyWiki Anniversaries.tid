Over on GitHub, we celebrated the contributors to TiddlyWiki by [[asking them|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/discussions/7983]] for their reflections on the anniversary. We received some interesting and thoughtful responses. For example, this from [[@FND|https://github.com/FND]]:

> TiddlyWiki had an immeasurable, enduring influence not just on my career, such as it is, but also on my values: To this day, I regularly find myself referring back to [[fundamental concepts|https://prepitaph.org/articles/creative-privacy/]] TiddlyWiki instilled in me - many of which are often forgotten or ignored elsewhere. Having this background thus helps me keep my bearings working in this industry, whether it's worshipping at the altar of technical complexity or even just remembering humans exist in the world of technology.

> By TiddlyWiki, I mean people. It was an immense privilege interacting with and learning from this community and the group Jeremy built around it. It also helps reminding myself that this privilege was afforded to me by sheer happenstance; I hope to be paying it forward.
