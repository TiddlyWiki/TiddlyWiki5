type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tm-unfold-all-tiddlers` message unfolds all tiddlers in the current story list. It does so by setting the text of all state tiddlers to: "<<.value "show">>".

|!Name |!Description |
|foldedStatePrefix |Prefix for the state tiddler in which the fold state is stored. |

<<.tip "The core uses a foldStatePrefix of `$:/state/folded/` to store the fold states for the default story view.">>
<<.warning "The state tiddlers title is computed as `foldStatePrefix + TiddlerTitle`. If the foldStatePrefix is not set, it will overwrite the text of the tiddler(s) itself, resulting in data loss. ">>

The `tm-unfold-all-tiddlers` message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the surrounding NavigatorWidget.
