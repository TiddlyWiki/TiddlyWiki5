A `tm-edit-bitmap-operation` invokes one of the available operations on a __surrounding__ bitmap editor. Therefore the message has to be dispatched within the editor in order for it to catch it. The following properties on the `event` object are required:

|!Name |!Description |
|param |Name of the operation to be executed, see ''below'' for a list of possible operations |
|//{any other params}// |Any other parameters are made available as variables within the context of the widget message. |


The `tm-edit-bitmap-operation` message is usually generated by a ButtonWidget or an [[ActionWidget|ActionWidgets]] and is handled by the surrounding bitmap editor.

! Bitmap Operations

At this point the following bitmap operations have been implemented:

|!Name |!Description |
|<<.def "resize">>|<<resizeDescription>> |
|<<.def "clear">>|<<clearDescription>> |


!Example

An example can be seen in [[$:/core/ui/EditorToolbar/size-dropdown]]:

	$param="resize"
	width={{$config-title$/new-width}}
	height={{$config-title$/new-height}}
/>
