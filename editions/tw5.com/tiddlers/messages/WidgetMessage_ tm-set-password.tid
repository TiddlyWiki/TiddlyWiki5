The `tm-set-password` message prompts the user for a new password and stores it in the password vault, replacing any existing password. It also sets the [[$:/isEncrypted]] tiddler. See EncryptionMechanism for details.

This message is typically generated with the ButtonWidget, and is handled by the core itself.
