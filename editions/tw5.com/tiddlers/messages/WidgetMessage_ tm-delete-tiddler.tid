The `tm-delete-tiddler` message deletes the specified tiddler and removes it from the current story. If the tiddler is a draft then it also deletes the tiddler specified in the `draft.of` field. The delete tiddler message requires the following properties on the `event` object:

|!Name |!Description |
|param |Title of the tiddler that is to be deleted |
|tiddlerTitle |Fallback title that is used if ''param'' isn't specified (automatically set by the ButtonWidget)  |

The delete tiddler message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the NavigatorWidget.

Use the [[ActionDeleteTiddlerWidget]] to delete a named tiddler without getting the "Do you wish to delete the tiddler" prompt.
