title: WidgetMessage: tm-close-window
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<<.from-version 5.2.2>>
The `tm-close-window` [[message|Messages]] closes an additional //browser// window that was opened with [[tm-open-window|WidgetMessage: tm-open-window]]. Specify which window to close by setting the value of <<.param param>> to the string used as <<.param windowID>> when opening the window.

|!Name |!Description |
|param //{default param}//  |String used as <<.param windowID>> when opening the window |

The `tm-close-window` message is best generated with the ActionSendMessageWidget, which in turn is triggered by a widget such as the ButtonWidget. It is handled by the core itself.

<<.tip """When used with the ActionSendMessageWidget, <<.param 'param'>> becomes <<.param '$param'>> """>>
<<.tip """To close all additional browser windows that were opened with [[tm-open-window|WidgetMessage: tm-open-window]] use [[WidgetMessage: tm-close-all-windows]]""">>
<<.tip """If the <<.param windowID>> parameter was used with [[tm-open-window|WidgetMessage: tm-open-window]] when opening a new window,  the value of <<.param windowID>> is available within that window in the variable <<.var tv-window-id>>""">>
