title: WidgetMessage: tm-fold-tiddler
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tm-fold-tiddler` message toggles the value of a state tiddler. It does so by setting the text of a state tiddler to either "<<.value "show">>" or "<<.value "hide">>", according to the fold state.

|!Name |!Description |
|param |ignored ... foldedState must be used |
|foldedState |State tiddler in which the fold state is stored |

<<.tip "The core uses a foldState prefix of `$:/state/folded/` + `tiddler title` to store the fold states for the default story view.">>

The `tm-fold-tiddler` message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the surrounding NavigatorWidget.

The core $:/core/ui/ViewTemplate defines a global variable `folded-state`, that is used with every tiddler. It's created like this: 

```
\define folded-state()
$:/state/folded/$(currentTiddler)$
\end
```
