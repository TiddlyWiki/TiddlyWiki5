type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tm-close-other-tiddlers` message removes all but a specified tiddler from the story list. It requires the following properties on the `event` object:

|!Name |!Description |
|param |Title of the tiddler that is not to be closed |
|tiddlerTitle |Fallback title that is used if ''param'' isn't specified (automatically set by the ButtonWidget)  |

The close other tiddlers message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the NavigatorWidget.
