type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tm-save-tiddler` message is applied to draft tiddlers. It saves the draft over the tiddler identified in the `draft.of` field and then deletes the draft. The save tiddler message requires the following properties on the `event` object:

|!Name |!Description |
|param |Title of the tiddler that is being switched out of edit mode |
|tiddlerTitle |Fallback title that is used if ''param'' isn't specified (automatically set by the ButtonWidget)  |

The save tiddler message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the NavigatorWidget.
