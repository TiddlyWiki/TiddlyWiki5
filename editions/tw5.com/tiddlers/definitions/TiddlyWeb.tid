title: TiddlyWeb

TiddlyWeb is a server application that puts [[Tiddlers]] on the web:

http://tiddlyweb.com/

TiddlyWeb can be used to host TiddlyWiki and TiddlyWiki5 wikis, making the individual tiddlers available over a flexible HTTP API.

TiddlyWeb was originally sponsored by [[Osmosoft]] at [[BT]] (along with TiddlySpace).
