title: TiddlyWebAdaptor
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

TiddlyWebAdaptor is a component of [[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]]. It provides the means to synchronise changes to tiddlers from the browser to a server, and from the server to the browser. It can be found in the plugin [[$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb]].

TiddlyWebAdaptor was designed to be compatible both with TiddlyWeb and with TiddlyWiki's own built-in server mechanism. The [[Bags and Recipes]] model is fully supported by [[TiddlyWeb]], but TiddlyWiki's built-in server only supports a simplified model with a single bag and a single recipe.
