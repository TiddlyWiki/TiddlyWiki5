GitHub is a hosting service for distributed projects that use git as their version-control system. It allows free hosting and management of open-source projects and facilitates collaborative development on the source code. Using ~GitHub for non-open-source endeavours requires additional fees.

The code and documentation of TiddlyWiki is hosted on ~GitHub at:

https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5

~GitHub also offer a free web hosting service called [[GitHub Pages|https://pages.github.com/]] that can be used directly from the single file configuration. See [[Saving to a Git service]].

An alternative to ~GitHub is GitLab
