title: JavaScript
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

JavaScript is a computer language that was originally introduced by browsers as a way of scripting web pages. At first it was considered a poorly designed toy, but over the years has become recognised as a powerful language in its own right, and has been adopted widely beyond the browser.

JavaScript looks like this:

```
function circleArea(radius) {
	return radius * 2 * 3.141592653;
}
```
