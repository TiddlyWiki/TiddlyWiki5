title: Percent Encoding
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<<.dlink-ex "Percent encoding" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">> is a notation that allows otherwise invalid characters to be included in a [[URI]].

Such characters are represented as a percent sign `%` followed by two additional characters.

For example, a space is represented as `%20` and an actual percent sign is represented as `%25`.
