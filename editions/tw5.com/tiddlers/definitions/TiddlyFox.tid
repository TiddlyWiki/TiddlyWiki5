TiddlyFox was an extension for older versions of Firefox that allowed standalone TiddlyWiki files to save their changes directly to the file system.

TiddlyFox is now obsolete due to its incompatibility with the latest versions of Firefox - see [[TiddlyFox Apocalypse]]. There are many alternatives to TiddlyFox, but none that work in precisely the same way -- see GettingStarted for details.
