~MultiWikiServer is a new development that drastically improves ~TiddlyWiki's capabilities when running as a server under Node.js. It brings ~TiddlyWiki up to par with common web-based tools like ~WordPress or ~MediaWiki by supporting multiple wikis and multiple users at the same time.

Planned features include:

* Hosting multiple wikis at once, using the [[Bags and Recipes]] mechanism for sharing data between them
* Robust authentication and authorisation options
* Improved handling of file uploads and attachments, allowing gigabyte video files to be uploaded and streamed
* Instantaneous synchronisation of changes between the server and all connected clients
* Workflow processing on the server, for example to automatically compress images, or to archive webpages

MWS does require basic knowledge of the command line and Node.js but is designed to be as simple as possible to setup and use. A few simple commands are all that is needed to complete the installation and start the server.

MWS is currently under development at ~GitHub but it is already functional and usable:
