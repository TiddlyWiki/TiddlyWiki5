title: TiddlyWiki5 Versioning
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Each release of TiddlyWiki5 is identified by a version number that complies with the [[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0|http://semver.org/]] standard.

! TiddlyWiki Core Version

According to the standard:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```

!! Alpha and Beta versions

While in alpha TiddlyWiki5 uses the pre-release label "alpha", for example:

```
5.0.1-alpha
```

Each new alpha or beta release will bump the `PATCH` version number. This breaks the strict semantics of versioning because `PATCH` increments are supposed to be reserved for compatible changes.

//Note that prior to ''5.0.1-alpha'', TiddlyWiki5 used version numbers formatted as ''5.0.0-alpha.19''. The change was made to enable the upgrade mechanism to recognise plugin updates from the version information.//

!! Interim versions

During development when a new release is being prepared, the pre-release label is set to `prerelease`.

! Plugin Versions

Version numbers

TiddlyWiki5 uses the version information attached to plugins for determining which of two plugins is more recent during an upgrade or import. The pre-release label is ignored when performing these comparisons.
