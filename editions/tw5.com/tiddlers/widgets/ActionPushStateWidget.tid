The action-pushstate widget is an ActionWidget that adds a tiddler title to the browser history stack without changing the URL. It allows users to navigate back to previously opened tiddlers using the browser's back/forward buttons.

! Content and Attributes

|!Attribute |!Description |
|$tiddler |The title of the tiddler to add to browser history. Defaults to the current tiddler if not specified |

! Usage

Use this widget together with navigation actions to add tiddlers to the browser history:

```
<$button>
  <$action-pushstate $tiddler="MyTiddler"/>
  <$action-navigate $to="MyTiddler"/>
  Open MyTiddler
</$button>
```

Or use it with the current tiddler:

```
<$button>
  <$action-pushstate/>
  <$action-navigate/>
  Navigate to Current Tiddler
</$button>
```

! How It Works

The widget uses the browser's History API (`history.pushState()`) to:

* Add an entry to the browser's history stack
* Store the tiddler title in the history state
* Keep the URL unchanged

When users click the browser back/forward buttons, the BrowserPopStateWidget will detect the state change and navigate to the stored tiddler.

! Important Notes

* The URL remains unchanged during navigation
* Works with the BrowserPopStateWidget to handle back/forward button events
* Compatible with all modern browsers that support the History API
* Does not interfere with normal TiddlyWiki history tracking
