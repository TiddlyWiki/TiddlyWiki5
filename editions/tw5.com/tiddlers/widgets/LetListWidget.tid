! Introduction

<<.from-version "5.3.7">> The <<.wid letlist>> widget allows multiple variables to be set in one operation, each to the list of results from evaluating a filter. It is similar to the <<.wlink LetWidget>> widget but assigns the complete list of results to the variable instead of just the first result.

! Content and Attributes

The content of the <<.wid letlist>> widget is the scope for the value assigned to the variable.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|//{attributes}// |Each attribute name specifies a variable name. The attribute value is a filter whose results are is assigned to the variable |

Attributes are evaluated in the order they are written. Attributes with the same name are allowed. Each time a duplicate attribute is encountered, it will replace the existing value set by the earlier duplicate.
