! Introduction

The image widget displays images that can be specified as a remote URL or the title of a local tiddler containing the image.

! Content and Attributes

Any content of the `<$image>` widget is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|source |The URL of the image, or the title of an image tiddler |
|width |The width of the image as a number |
|height |The height of the image |
|tooltip |The tooltip to be displayed over the image |
|class |CSS classes to be assigned to the `<img>` element |

! External Images and the ''_canonical_uri'' field

When used to display tiddler-based images, the image widget operates in two distinct modes:

* If the ''_canonical_uri'' field is present then it is used as the ''src'' attribute of the generated `<img>` element and the ''text'' field is ignored
* Without the ''_canonical_uri'' field, the image widget generates an `<img>` element that embeds the image data directly using a `data:` URI.

See ExternalImages for more details.
