! Introduction

The data widget is used with the <<.wlink TestCaseWidget>> widget and the [[Innerwiki Plugin]] to specify payload tiddlers that are to be included in the test case or innerwiki.

! Content and Attributes

The content of the data widget is rendered as if the data widget were not present. It supports the following attributes:

|!Attribute |!Description |
|<<.attr $tiddler>> |Optional title of a tiddler to be used as a payload tiddler (optional) |
|<<.attr $filter>> |Optional filter string identifying tiddlers to be used as payload tiddlers (optional) |
|<<.attr $compound-tiddler>> |Optional title of a tiddler containing payload tiddlers in `text/vnd.tiddlywiki-multiple` format (see below) |
|//any attribute<br>not starting<br>with $// |Field values to be assigned to the payload tiddler(s) |

The data widget is not rendered when used within the <<.wlink TestCaseWidget>> widget or the [[Innerwiki Plugin]] but for ease of testing, when used elsewhere it renders a JSON representation of the payload tiddlers.

Without any of the attributes <<.attr $tiddler>>, <<.attr $filter>> or <<.attr $compound-tiddler>>, any attributes whose name does not start with $ are used as the field values for creating a single new tiddler. For example, here a tiddler with the title "Epsilon" and the text "Theta" is created:

<<testcase "TestCases/DataWidget/SimpleTiddler">>

If any of the attributes <<.attr $tiddler>>, <<.attr $filter>> or <<.attr $compound-tiddler>> are specified then they are used to generate base tiddlers that are then modified with the addition of fields derived from any attributes whose name does not start with $.

This example, here we specify a copy of the "HelloThere" tiddler with the addition of the field "custom" set to "Alpha":

<<testcase "TestCases/DataWidget/ImportedTiddler">>

This example injects all image tiddlers with the addition of the field "custom" set to "Beta":

<<testcase "TestCases/DataWidget/ImportedFilter">>

! Compound Tiddlers

Compound tiddlers provide a way to easily create multiple tiddlers from within a single tiddler. They are contained in tiddlers of type `text/vnd.tiddlywiki-multiple`. The text field consists of a series of tiddlers in the same format as `.tid` files, each separated by a line containing a single `+` character.

<<testcase "TestCases/DataWidget/ImportCompound">>

Here is a more complex example of the content of a compound tiddler:

```
title: First
tags: one two

This is the first tiddler
+
title: Second
tags: three four

This is the second tiddler
+
title: third
tags: five six

This is the third tiddler
```
