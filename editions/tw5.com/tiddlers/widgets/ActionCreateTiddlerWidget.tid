! Introduction

The <<.wid "action-createtiddler">> widget is an [[action widget|ActionWidgets]] that creates new tiddlers. Action widgets are used within triggering widgets such as the ButtonWidget.

There are several //differences// from the [[tm-new-tiddler message|WidgetMessage: tm-new-tiddler]]:

* The new tiddler is not automatically displayed in the [[story river|Story River]]
* The title of the new tiddler is made available for subsequent operations

! Content and Attributes

The ''action-createtiddler'' widget is invisible.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|$basetitle |The initial title that will be attempted. If a tiddler with that title already exists, then a numerical counter is added to the title and incremented until it is unique|
|$savetitle |<<.deprecated-since "5.1.20" "ActionCreateTiddlerWidget Example 5">> A text reference identifying a field or index into which the title of the newly created tiddler will be stored after it is created |
|$savedrafttitle |<<.deprecated-since "5.1.20" "ActionCreateTiddlerWidget Example 5">> A text reference identifying a field or index into which the draft title associated with the newly created tiddler will be stored after it is created. This is useful when using a sequence of action widgets to create a new tiddler, put it into edit mode, and position it within the list of its parent tag |
|$timestamp |Specifies whether the timestamp(s) of the target tiddler will be updated (''modified'' and ''modifier'', plus ''created'' and ''creator'' for newly created tiddlers). Can be "yes" (the default) or "no" |

|//{any attributes not starting with $}// |Each attribute name specifies a field to be created in the new tiddler  |
