You can import content into a ~TiddlyWiki from other ~TiddlyWikis or from external files.

!! Import non-tiddler content

There are several ways to import and convert content into tiddlers, including text, images, pdf documents, etc:

* Use the <<.icon $:/core/images/import-button>> ''import'' button (under the ''Tools'' tab in the sidebar) to select a local file
* Drag and drop files from Windows Explorer or OS X Finder etc. into the ~TiddlyWiki browser window
* Paste content directly from the clipboard using the menu or keyboard shortcut (<kbd>ctrl-V</kbd> or <kbd>cmd-V</kbd>)
** Currently supported in Chrome, Firefox and Edge (but not Internet Explorer)

Most files are converted into individual tiddlers. The exceptions are:

* ''.html'' files that are recognised as a ~TiddlyWiki file are parsed to extract the tiddlers within them
* ''.json'' files are parsed to extract the tiddlers within them. They can be created by [[exporting them|How to export tiddlers]] from another ~TiddlyWiki. ~TiddlyWiki accepts JSON files that contain either a single tiddler fields object, or an array of tiddler fields objects

!! "Drag'n drop" tiddlers between ~TiddlyWikis

You can [[drag and drop|Drag and Drop]] tiddlers from other ~TiddlyWiki browser windows into your ~TiddlyWiki. 

* Drag a [[tiddler link|TiddlerLinks]] to import a single tiddler
* Drag a [[tag pill|Tagging]] to import all of the tiddlers that carry that tag.
