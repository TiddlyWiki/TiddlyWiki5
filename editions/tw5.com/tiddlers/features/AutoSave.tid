title: AutoSave
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If there is a SaverModule available that supports it, TiddlyWiki will automatically trigger a save of the current document on clicking {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''tick'' or {{$:/core/images/delete-button}} ''delete'' when editing a tiddler.

You should see a yellow notification at the top right of the window to confirm that an automatic save has taken place.

Automatic saving can be enabled or disabled through the ''Saving'' tab of the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]]. Behind the scenes, it is controlled through the configuration tiddler [[$:/config/AutoSave]], which must have the value ''yes'' to enable automatic saving.
