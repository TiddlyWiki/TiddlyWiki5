''name-sort'' function is defined as:

```
\function  name-sort() "[{!!last-name}] [{!!first-name}] +[join[, ]]"
```

* You’ll see in the “''Sorted by (tiddler) Title''” section that the people are sorted by their Person/1, Person/2, ...

* In the ''People'' section, they’re ''sorted by last name'', and for those with the same last name, by first name. And that’s exactly what I was looking for.
