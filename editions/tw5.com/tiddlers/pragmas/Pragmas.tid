A <<.def pragma>> is a special component of WikiText that provides control over the way the remaining text is parsed.

Pragmas occupy lines that start with `\`. They can only appear at the start of the text of a tiddler, but blank lines and comments are allowed between them. If a pragma appears in the main body of the text, it is treated as if it was ordinary text.

<<.from-version "5.2.6">> Pragmas can have preceding optional whitespace characters.

The following pragmas are available:
