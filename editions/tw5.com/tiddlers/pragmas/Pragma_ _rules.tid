The ''\rules'' [[pragma|Pragmas]] adjusts the set of parser rules used to parse the remaining text.

```
\rules only|expect <rule-list>
```

The list of available parser rules can be consulted in $:/ControlPanel -> Info -> Advanced -> Parsing.

For example, in stylesheets it is typical to only use the rules associated with macros and transclusions:

```
\rules only filteredtranscludeinline transcludeinline macrodef macrocallinline
```

Some users prefer not to use CamelCase links:

```
\rules except prettylink
```
