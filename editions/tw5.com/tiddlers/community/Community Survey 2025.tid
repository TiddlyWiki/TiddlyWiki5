The core developers work hard year by year to continuously improve ~TiddlyWiki. Part of the satisfaction is that we are not just building software for ourselves, weâ€™re serving the needs of a wider community of users.

That begs the question of how we can understand the needs of these other users. We do it in an informal way through every interaction with users on the forum, or on GitHub, but once in a while it can be useful to do take a more formal approach, such as survey.

So, we would like to invite you to participate in the ~TiddlyWiki Community Survey 2025. This brief, anonymous survey is designed to give us insight into the needs of TiddlyWiki users, with a mix of structured and freeform questions.

The results of this survey will help inform future developments, helping us focus on what would make TiddlyWiki better for you, both as software and as a community. Even longer-term, it will help us refine the future vision of the project, ensuring it is based on the needs of our community.

The survey will remain open until Monday 11th August 2025. Shortly afterwards, we will aggregate and share the findings.

!! The Great Viral TiddlyWiki Interview Project (2010)

In 2010, we invited TiddlyWiki users to join the interview project with these words:

> For many people that use it. there is a distinct discovery moment when TiddlyWiki explodes in their brain. For others, it is a challenge to get their heads around TiddlyWiki at all.
>
> This project explores how people think about TiddlyWiki by collecting together responses to a set of questions about it.

You can explore the questions and responses on this new site:
