Semantic colors are set of CSS to apply colorful theme to individual tiddlers for categorization purpose.

Tiddlywiki "semantic colors" has two objectives:

# How it is simply possible to apply theme to an individual tiddler
# Use semantic colors for categorization

;Some use cases
:Learning materials (each topic, category can have dedicated semantic color, like learning a foreign language)
:Slideshow (section divider, each part can have a semantic color)
:Books and tutorials ( different semantic colors can be applied to chapters, specific subjects, like example tiddlers)
:Visual tags (instead of looking for tag bar and see to what category this subject (tiddler) belongs, you can identify it by its semantic color)
