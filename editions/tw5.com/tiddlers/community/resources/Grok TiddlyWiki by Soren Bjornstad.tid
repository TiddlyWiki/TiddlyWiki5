Grok ~TiddlyWiki by Soren Bjornstad is an interactive learning environment for TiddlyWiki. It bundles three complementary modes of learning into one TiddlyWiki:

* It ''explains concepts'' using English text and code examples
* It ''assigns exercises'' that help you apply and practice what you've learned
* It ''presents takeaways'', questions about key terms, concepts, or skills, for review as you continue through the book, to help you retain what you've learned over a longer period of time
