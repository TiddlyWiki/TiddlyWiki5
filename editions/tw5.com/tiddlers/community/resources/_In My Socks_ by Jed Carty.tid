I made this so that some of my friends with absolutely no coding experience could use some of the better features of TW5 without having to learn much. I am hopefully going to continue updating it as I learn new things. There isn't really anything here that isn't available in plenty of other places, but I figured that since I spent a while putting it together and people keep saying that TW needs more documentation I would post it here.
