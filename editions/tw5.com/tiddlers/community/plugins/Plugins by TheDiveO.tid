[[TheDiveO's Third Flow|http://thediveo.github.io/ThirdFlow/]] plugin construction system:

<<<
The ~ThirdFlow plugin brings to you another way to develop customization plugins for TiddlyWiki 5. It is not enforcing a specific development flow, it simply tries to help you. Otherwise, it tries to stay out of your way.
<<<

[[TheDiveO's FontAwesome|http://thediveo.github.io/TW5FontAwesome/]] plugin:

<<<
The FontAwesome plugin supports embedding  Font Awesome in  TiddlyWiki 5. There is no need to install this font into your operating system in order to use it with TiddlyWiki 5. The font is already embedded in this TiddlyWiki 5 customization plugin instead, so nothing else to install.
