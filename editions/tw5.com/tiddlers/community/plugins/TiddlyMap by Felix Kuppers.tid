~TiddlyMap is a TiddlyWiki plugin that allows you to link your wiki-topics (tiddlers) in order to create clickable graphs. By creating relations between your topics you can easily do the following:

* Create concept maps and quickly manifest your ideas in tiddlers.
* Create task-dependency graphs to organise and describe your tasks.
* Visualise your topic structures to get an immediate grasp of topics and relations.

In general you may create, visualise and describe any network-structure you have in mind.
