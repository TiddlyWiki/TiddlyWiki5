A plugin to integrate the popular [[lunr.js|https://lunrjs.com/]] search engine, giving TiddlyWiki much more sophisticated search capabilities:

Provides an alternative search result list that orders results by search relevance and ignores differences in word forms (ex. //tag// vs //tags//).

On my personal wiki, I have the problem that there are terms I use across a lot of tiddlers, and sometimes I'll use different forms (such as the aforementioned //tag// vs //tags//).  I wanted a plugin to allow me to find the tiddler I'm looking for quickly and didn't require me to worry about how I declined a noun or inflected a verb - so I wrote this plugin, which provides an alternative search list powered by [[lunr.js|https://lunrjs.com/]].
