Slides and Stories is a repository of the tools to optimise TW for scientific research and for presenting and publishing results.

!~SlidesnStories 
...is a tool to save and reload sets of Tiddlers. This is already working, The aim is to develop a mechanism to transform these into instant slideshows.

!~MetaTabs 
is a tool which gives you the possibility to attach and show specific information in tabs at the bottom of each Tiddler: ideas, notes, tasks, stories and presentations, comments, annotations and footnotes. <br>
It is inspired by ~MagicTabs and Tiddlyscholar by Alberto Molina PÃ©rez, which are very elaborated tools that alas do not seem to be in active development any more.
I wanted to change the behaviour in some ways. For example I wanted show tabs only if they have content. 

!...furthermore there is 
* an export-plugin,
* a footnote-plugin,
* and a plugin to rearrange Tiddlers in the ~StoryRiver
