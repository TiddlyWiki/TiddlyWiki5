~BuggyJay's ~TiddlyClip browser extension for Firefox permits clipping of text and graphics from web pages:

{{!!url}}

<<<
~TiddlyClip allows parts of webpages to be clipped into a ~TiddlyWiki, and consists of two parts, the browser addon and the ~TiddlyWiki plugin. The addon is completely memoryless, any configuration is determined by the current ~TiddlyWiki that the user has select to work with (we say that the addon is docked to the ~TiddlyWiki). ~TiddlyClip is designed to work (in a basic mode) without configuration. Once the addon and plugin are installed, all the user has to do is select which TW to dock to.
