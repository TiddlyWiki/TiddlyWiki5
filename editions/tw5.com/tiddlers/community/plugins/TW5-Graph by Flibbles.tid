TW5-Graph is a framework to integrate TiddlyWiki with existing graphing and visualization engines (such as [[Vis-Network|https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/]]). The plugin allows for easy and sophisticated graphs to represent your tiddlers, or whatever else you want.

It is the spiritual successor to [[TiddlyMap|TiddlyMap Plugin by Felix KÃ¼ppers]].

With TW5-Graph you can:

* Quickly create and edit graphs through a simple point-and-click GUI
* Use wikitext widgets to create customized graphs and template to exactly match your needs
* Easily create dynamic graphs to represent changing state or individual tiddlers

There's loads TW5-Graph can do for you. [[Check out its demo website here.|https://flibbles.github.io/tw5-graph/]]
