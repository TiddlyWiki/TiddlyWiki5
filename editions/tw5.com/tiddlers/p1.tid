* p1 toc-inlucdes itself for recursion detection testing
* toc-include also has: <code>{{!!toc-include}}</code> for CTRL-click testing on p2 -> It should expand the whole path
* tiddler [[aaa]] is a "tagLike" field so it ''cannot'' be shown with expand chevron -> That's intended

---

p1 has a special toc-include field: <code><$view field=toc-include /></code>

It's intended to add  a second `parentField: dad`, which DOES NOT WORK ATM
