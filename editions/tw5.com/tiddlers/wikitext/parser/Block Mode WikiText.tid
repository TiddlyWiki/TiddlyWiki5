type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Some WikiText is recognised only while the parser is in block mode.

Common characteristics of such block mode WikiText:

* At least one entire line is required to delimit the WikiText.
* The closing punctuation must come at the end of the line (in some cases the end of the line //is// the closing punctuation.

|!~WikiText|!Punctuation|
|[[Block Quotes in WikiText]] |Multi-line block quotes are enclosed by lines containing only the text `<<<`; single line block quotes are also possible.|
|[[Code Blocks in WikiText]]|Enclosed by lines containing only the text <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>|
|[[Definitions in WikiText]]|Each term is on its own line and each definition is on its own line.|
|[[Hard Linebreaks in WikiText]]|Enclosed by lines containing only the text `"""`.|
|[[Headings in WikiText]]|Entire line starting with `!`.|
|[[Horizontal Rules in WikiText]]|A line containing only the text `---`.|
|[[Lists in WikiText]]|Each list item is on its own line.|
|[[Paragraphs in WikiText]]|Any text other than the start punctuation of one of the other block mode WikiText will start a paragraph. Even the start punctuation of inline mode WikiText will start a paragraph. The parser includes all following lines into the paragraph until it encounters a blank line.|
|[[Styles and Classes in WikiText]]|Enclosed by lines starting with `@@`.|
|[[Tables in WikiText]]|Each table row is a line starting and ending with `|`.|
|[[Typed Blocks in WikiText]]|Enclosed by lines starting with `$$`.|

The above WikiText types are only recognised in ''block mode''. However, the text <<.em enclosed>> by most of them will be parsed in ''inline mode'' ([[Block Quotes in WikiText]] and [[Styles and Classes in WikiText]] are the two exceptions in which the parser will continue in ''block mode''). While in ''inline mode'' the parser may encounter something which moves it to ''block mode'' (see [[WikiText parser mode transitions]]).

At the end of the terminating line, the parser will return to ''block mode''. 
<<.tip 'Note: [[Hard Linebreaks in WikiText]] require an extra blank line after the trailing `"""` before the parser will return to <strong>block mode</strong>.'>>

If the punctuation for the above types of WikiText is encountered while the parser is in ''inline mode'', it will be //ignored// and output as-is.
