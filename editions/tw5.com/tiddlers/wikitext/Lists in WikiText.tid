! Bulleted Lists

You can create bulleted (unordered) lists with `*` characters (<<.icon $:/core/images/list-bullet>>):

<<wikitext-example src:"* First list item
* Second list item
** A subitem
* Third list item
">>

! Numbered Lists

Numbered (ordered) lists use `#` instead of `*` (<<.icon $:/core/images/list-number>>):

# First item
# Second item
# Third item

You can also mix ordered and unordered list items:

<<wikitext-example src:"* To do today
*# Eat
* To get someone else to do
*# This
*# That
*## And the other
">>

Here's an example the other way around, with numbers as the first level:

<<wikitext-example src:"# To do today
#* Eat
# To get someone else to do
#* This
#* That
#** And the other
">>

! CSS Classes

You can also assign a CSS class to an individual member of a list with this notation:

<<wikitext-example src:"* List One
*.tc-muted List Two
* List Three
">>

! Mixing Lists and Block Quotes

Note that [[Block Quotes in WikiText]] can be mixed with lists. For example:

<<wikitext-example src:"* List One
** List Two
**> A quote
**> Another quote
* List Three
">>

! Paragraphs in Lists

Entries in the list are delimited with a linebreak, making it impossible to include linebreaks within a list entry. There are a couple of workarounds.

First, you can transclude paragraph content from another tiddler. For example:

```
* First entry
* <$transclude tiddler="MyTiddler" mode="block"/>
* Third entry
```

Secondly, you can use an HTML "div" element to contain the multiline content. For example:

```
# Step 1
# Step 2
# Step 3<div>

Here is the first of several paragraphs. Note that the double linebreak preceding this paragraph is significant.

And here is the second of several paragraphs.
</div>
# Step 4
# Step 5
# Step 6
```
