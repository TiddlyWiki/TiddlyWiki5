!! Bold vs Strong

In TW we use the term "bold" instead of "strong" because most users are used to it. ... The rendering process converts our "bold text" into the STRONG HTML element. 

>The `<strong>` element is for content that is of greater importance, while the `<b>` element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong#b_vs._strong

!! Underline vs. Underscore

>Use underline to describe text formatting that puts a line under the characters. Use underscore to refer to the underscore character ( _ ).
>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/u/underline-vs-underscore

!! Emphasis vs Italics

>The `<em>` element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the `<i>` element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such as a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use `<cite>`.)
