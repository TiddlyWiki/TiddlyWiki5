title: Paragraphs in WikiText
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

To mark the end of a paragraph in TiddlyWiki you need to type `enter` twice to create a double line break:

```
This is the first paragraph.

And this is the second paragraph.
```

Single line breaks are ignored within paragraphs. For example:

<<wikitext-example src:"This is a
paragraph made
up of
short lines">>

For situations where this behaviour isn't convenient, you can also use [[Hard Linebreaks in WikiText]].
