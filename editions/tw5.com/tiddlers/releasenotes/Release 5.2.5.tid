This is a bug fix release intended to resolve backwards compatibility issues discovered in v5.2.4. See [[this GitHub ticket|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/issues/7126]] for the background.

The issues are entirely cosmetic stylesheet changes, and do not affect the functionality of TiddlyWiki. However, we encourage all users to upgrade to this new version for consistency.

Since v5.2.5 replaces v5.2.4 that was only released for a week, here is the [[release note for v5.2.4|Release 5.2.4]].
