** Instead of `$:/state/tab/sidebar-{$:/core/ui/SideBar|$:/core/ui/SideBar||}{$:/core/ui/PageTemplate|$:/core/ui/PageTemplate||}` one gets `$:/state/tab/sidebar-{1743827719}`

** Existing TiddlyWikiFolders will need updating to include ''Vanilla'' as an additional theme
* The page building blocks are now driven by the system tag `$:/tags/PageTemplate`
** [[$:/TopSideBar]] and [[$:/LeftSideBar]] are no longer specially treated; use the new tag instead
