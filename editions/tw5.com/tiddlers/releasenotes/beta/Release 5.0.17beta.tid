//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.0.16-beta...v5.0.17-beta]]//

!! Highlights

This release includes major improvements from @giffmex to the welcome and tutorial documentation, and new development docs incorporating [[the work|https://github.com/cjrk/saa-tw]] of @cheigele and @cjrk.

!! Incompatible Changes

!!! Change System Tag `$:/tags/stylesheet` with `$:/tags/Stylesheet`

The [[issue|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/824]] is that the capitalisation of `$:/tags/stylesheet` is not consistent with other system tags. This release adds support for `$:/tags/Stylesheet`, and adds a deprecation warning if `$:/tags/stylesheet` is used. Support for `$:/tags/stylesheet` will be removed before the beta.

* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/f6ff0a7f715bdf12dfba6556f72c49ea2c3016b0]] support for `$:/tags/Stylesheet` and a deprecation warning when `$:/tags/stylesheet` is used

!!! Change ButtonWidget `title` attribute to `tooltip`

The use of the `title` attribute in the ButtonWidget was not consistent with the `tooltip` attribute used by the ImageWidget and LinkWidget. This release adds support for the `tooltip` attribute to the ButtonWidget alongside the existing support for the `title` attribute, but with a deprecation warning.

* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/b7f638aef3094d0552db2f72330b40a526113bd5]] `tooltip` attribute to ButtonWidget

!!! Removing Support for RegExp Filter Operands

As discussed in [[the associated ticket|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/762]], the support for regular expression filter operands is incomplete and inconsistent. The plan is to remove support for this feature in the next release. A new filter operator has been provided to replace it, along with the addition of a deprecation warning that is displayed whenever regular expression filter operators are used.

* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/f4fff7a33037ba9dd537379bcb44a52a280868d6]] new <<.olink regexp>> operator
* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/d45c417c187fe3dcc35ee7a308e64feebc7b185b]] deprecation warning for regular expression filter operators

!!! Repository Reorganisation

The goal is to make the TiddlyWiki repository easier to comprehend for newcomers.

* [[Moved|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/6e9cd5943703f7137e819fcb85376423b9c930d5]] scripts into a separate `bin` folder
