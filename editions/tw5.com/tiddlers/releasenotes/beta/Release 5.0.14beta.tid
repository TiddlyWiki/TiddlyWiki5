//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.0.13-beta...v5.0.14-beta]]//

!! Major Changes

!!! Improved Control Panel Plugins Tab

The ''Plugins'' tab of the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] has been improved with the addition of documentation tabs that plugins can use to show documentation. There is also a larger draggable area for dragging tiddlers across to other wikis.

!!! Configurable Button Toolbars

The page toolbar and the tiddler toolbars can now be configured with several new buttons - see the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] under the ''Appearance'' and ''Toolbars'' tabs.

The sidebar tools tab now shows all the available page controls, allowing them to be invoked or checked to appear in the toolbar. The tiddler info area now includes a tools tab that includes buttons for all the tiddler actions.

!!! Upgrade Mechanism

There are two components:

* A more flexible ImportMechanism that:
** Presents incoming tiddlers as a pending import list that allows the user to inspect them and, if necessary, explicitly deselect them from the actual import
** Provides UpgraderModules with an opportunity to process each incoming tiddler
*** The [[plugin upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/plugins.js]] module handles version checking of plugins and upgrading them from a special UpgradeLibrary plugin tiddler
*** The [[system upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/system.js]] module is responsible for suppressing the importing of certain system tiddlers (currently [[$:/StoryList]] and [[$:/HistoryList]])
*** The [[themetweak upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/themetweaks.js]] module handles migrating theme tweaks from their pre-5.0.14-beta format (see below)
* An UpgradePlugin and associated edition that provides a custom, single-purpose user interface for upgrading standalone TiddlyWiki files - see https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html

!!! Improvements to CamelCase Recognition

TiddlyWiki now takes a much more conservative approach to recognising CamelCase terms that should be automatically linked. Previously, the dash and underscore were treated as lower case letters, leading to a number of false positives. See the [[GitHub bug #337|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/issues/337]] for details.

!!! Automatic Permalinking Off by Default

With previous beta releases of TiddlyWiki the browser address bar is automatically updated so that it dynamically reflects the tiddlers that are currently open. This makes it easier to get a permalink for copying and pasting elsewhere, but it leads to much confusion for casual users who don't always understand why unexpected tiddlers are being displayed after they have refreshed the page in the browser.

For 5.0.14-beta, the setting has been changed. Visit [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] ''Advanced''/''Settings'' to switch the setting back to "Include the target tiddler and the current story sequence".
