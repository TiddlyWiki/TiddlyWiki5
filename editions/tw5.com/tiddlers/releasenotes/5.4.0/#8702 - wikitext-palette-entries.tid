description: Palette entries using wikification will no longer work
impact-type: deprecation

Before v5.4.0, TiddlyWiki palette entries were interpreted as WikiText, allowing the familiar `<<colour ...>>` macro to be used within them. In fact, these entries can use any valid wikitext, including widgets and conditionals.

From v5.4.0 onwards, palette entries are treated as filter expressions. To improve backwards compatibility there is special handling to transform the `<<colour ...>>` macro into the equivalent filter expression `[tf.colour[...]]`. However, other wikitext constructs are not supported and will not function correctly.
