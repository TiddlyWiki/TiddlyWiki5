title: Release Notes and Changes Internals

! Release Notes

Release notes describe the changes in a release, and the impact of those changes.

Release note fields:

* `caption` - the plain version number (eg `5.4.0`)
* `created` - in DateFormat
* `modified` - in DateFormat
* `released` - in DateFormat -- only present if the release has been published
* `tags` - must include `ReleaseNotes`
* `title` - the title of the release note (eg `Release 5.4.0`)
* `description` - a brief description of the release
* `text` - see below

The text of the release note should consist of the definition of a variable `release-introduction` followed by the invocation of the `releasenote` procedure. For example:

```
\define release-introduction()
Release v5.4.0 includes major improvements in a number of areas. See the [[project plan|https://github.com/orgs/TiddlyWiki/projects/4]] for more details.
\end release-introduction

<<releasenote 5.4.0>>
```

* `description` - brief description of the change
* `release` - the release with which this change note is associated (eg `5.4.0`)
* `github-links` - a list of the ~GitHub links associated with this change
