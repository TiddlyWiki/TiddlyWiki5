This is a bug fix release intended to resolve a backwards compatibility issue discovered in v5.2.6. See [[this GitHub ticket|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/issues/7371]] for the background.

The issue is that trailing newlines within a macro definitions were being ignored, which affected whether the content were parsed in inline or block mode.

Since v5.2.7 replaces v5.2.6 that was only released for less than a week, here is the [[release note for v5.2.6|Release 5.2.6]].
