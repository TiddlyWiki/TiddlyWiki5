//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.0.0-alpha.12...v5.0.0-alpha.13]]//

This release has several bug fixes:

* Fixes to DaveGifford's themes ''blanca'', ''blue'' and ''rocker''
* Fix an issue with the `<$edit-text>` widget
* Documentation updates
* Improved deployment scripts
* Made the modifier field in the subtitle be a link
* Styling improvements for the CodeMirror plugin
* Improved the ViewWidget so that it falls back to displaying its content if the field/property is missing or empty
* Extend use of the built-in `<<tabs>>` macro to the tiddler info panel, the control panel and the sidebar
** This means that you can add new tabs by creating tiddlers with these tags, and optionally a `caption` field for the text of the tab:
*** [[$:/tags/TiddlerInfo]] for tiddler info panel tabs
*** [[$:/tags/ControlPanel]] for control panel tabs
*** [[$:/tags/SideBar]] for sidebar tabs
*** [[$:/tags/MoreSideBar]] for tabs in the "more" sidebar
*** Change the order of tabs by adjusting the `list` field of the corresponding tag tiddler
