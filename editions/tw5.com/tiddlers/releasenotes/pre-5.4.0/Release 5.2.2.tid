! Highlights

!! <<.link-badge-updated "https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6427">> [[Highlight Plugin]] to use highlight.js v11.4.0

This is a major upgrade to the latest version of highlight.js. The new version has many improvements, including better support for Fortran.

<<.warning """The new version of the [[Highlight Plugin]] requires a modern browser that fully supports JavaScript ES6 (released in 2015). The older version is still available as the ''highlight-legacy'' plugin for users who need to use an older browser.""">>

!! <<.link-badge-extended "https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6498">> support for secondary windows

The [[WidgetMessage: tm-open-window]] now supports an optional `windowID` parameter so that opened windows can be closed with the new [[WidgetMessage: tm-close-window]] message. There is also a new [[WidgetMessage: tm-close-all-windows]] message which closes all secondary windows.

!! <<.link-badge-added "https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6421">> support for line breaks within filtered transcluded attributes

To improve readability, it is now possible to use newlines as whitespace within filtered transcluded attributes of HTML elements and widgets. For example:

```
<span class={{{
	[<currentTiddler>addsuffix[-primaryList]]
	:except[<searchListState>get[text]]
	:and[then[]else[tc-list-item-selected]]
}}}>
```

!! <<.link-badge-fixed "https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6383">> inconsistent ordering of tagged tiddlers

This was a long standing bug that manifested itself in several ways.

The root cause was that the order in which tiddlers were enumerated depended upon the order in which they had been added to the store.

The effect was that lists based on enumerating tiddlers would show different results depending upon whether new tiddlers were added since the wiki was reloaded.

For example, adding a new tiddler with a given tag previously caused the new tiddler to appear at the bottom of the tag pill listing for that tag. Saving and reloading the wiki would reorder the list to put the new tiddler in the correct position.

The fix ensures that the enumeration order remains consistent.

!! <<.link-badge-fixed "https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki5/pull/6553">> some incorrectly nested `<span>` and `<div>` elements

TiddlyWiki's core page layout has historically included several instances of inline `<span>` elements containing block `<div>` elements, something that is technically invalid HTML. In practice, browsers have always handled these cases leniently to make the page work but it has also been unhelpful for developers to encountering invalid HTML constructions in their first interactions with TiddlyWiki.

The immediate prompt for starting to fix these issue now is that Chrome v100 [[includes a change|https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/4a76c96d2a4021257e691058c1fe1fb60d9d8327]] that causes some of these misnested elements to be rendered correctly visually but to be unclickable in some situations. (The change is [[reverted|https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/abadd1181ca70cf3d1ac7e7878d46b1d3173a2e0]] in Chrome v102, but it still makes sense to fix it)
