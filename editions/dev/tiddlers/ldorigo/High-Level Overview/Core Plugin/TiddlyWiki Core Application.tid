title: TiddlyWiki Core Application

The microkernel builds up the base functionality to manage tiddlers by providing a basic wiki store and a barebone tiddler model.
The microkernel can also load a set of (decrypted) tiddlers and provides a module system, enabling a developer to extend the kernel and add functionality with module tiddlers and plug-ins.

For instance, the TiddlyWiki Core Application is provided as a single plug-in.
In this part we want to focus on the TiddlyWiki core plug-in.
After describing how new functionality is added directly to the wiki store,
we show how the core plug-in realises persistence of tiddlers.
The last part describes how TiddlyWiki builds an UI out of tiddlers and WikiText.
