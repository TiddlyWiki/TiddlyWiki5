title: Microkernel Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the ~TiddlyWiki-kernel. ~TiddlyWiki is based on a micro-kernel which provides only a small stack of functions. This design decision was made to introduce a cleaner mechanism for customisation of ~TiddlyWiki. This section also describes the data-model of ~TiddlyWiki called tiddler. And it gives a overview to the module system which developers can use to extend the functionality of the ~TiddlyWiki application.
