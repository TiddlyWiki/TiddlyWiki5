title: Undefined widget tutorial
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Let's start be defining a minimal widget which does nothing. It doesn't support any attributes, no child elements, and it doesn't output anything. The name of the widget will be `donothing`. If it does nothing, then how can we verify after writing the code that we accomplished anything? Well, let's see what happens when an undefined widget is referenced.
