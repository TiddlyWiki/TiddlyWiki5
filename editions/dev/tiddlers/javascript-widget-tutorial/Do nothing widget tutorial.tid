title: Do nothing widget tutorial
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In order to define a widget in a tiddler, the tiddler must satisfy these requirements:

* type field is application/javascript
* module-type field is widget
* the text field contains the javascript code

The [[donothing.js]] tiddler fulfills the requirements and its code looks like this:
{{donothing.js}}
That code does 2 key things:

* Imports the core Widget class ([[$:/core/modules/widgets/widget.js]])
* exports the class in an attribute with the name we want our widget to have (`donothing`)

Here's what it looks like:
{{Do nothing widget demo}}
And it worked. No error message this time.

''Exercise'': Modify [[donothing.js]] and [[Do nothing widget demo]] so the widget is named `noop` instead of `donothing`
