title: How to create a translation for TiddlyWiki
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Prerequisites

* [[TiddlyWiki on Node.js|https://tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlyWiki%20on%20Node.js]]
* A GitHub account to submit the translation to tiddlywiki.com

! Setting Up

# Fork the TiddlyWiki GitHub repository (https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5)
#* If your GitHub username is JoeBloggs, your fork will be https://github.com/JoeBloggs/TiddlyWiki5
# Create a branch with the name of the translation you intend to create (eg "cy-GB" for "Welsh (United Kingdom)")
#* IETF language codes: http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm
# Clone your forked repository to your computer (eg, `/MyTranslation/TiddlyWiki5`)
# Create a sibling directory `/MyTranslation/jermolene.github.io`
# Create a new folder in `<repo>/languages` for your translation
# Copy the contents of `<repo>/core/language/en-GB` into your translation folder
# Create a `plugin.info` file (see below) in your translation folder
# Edit `<repo>/editions/tw5.com/tiddlywiki.info` to add your language to the list
# Run `../build.jermolene.github.io/quick-bld.sh` to build TiddlyWiki
# Open the TiddlyWiki file at `/MyTranslation/jermolene.github.io/index.html`
# You should see your translation listed in the control panel, but the text of the translation will still be in British English
# Edit the `.tid` and `.multids` files in your language folder to translate the English text

Content of `plugin.info` for Joe Bloggs' Welsh translation:

```js
{
	"title": "$:/languages/cy-GB",
	"name": "cy-GB",
	"plugin-type": "language",
	"description": "Welsh (British)",
	"author": "JoeBloggs",
	"core-version": ">=5.0.0"
}
```

[[MultiTiddlerFiles|https://tiddlywiki.com/#MultiTiddlerFiles]] make it possible to pack the text of several tiddlers in a single text file, simplifying some editing tasks.

! Handling Updates

Sometimes the master en-GB language tiddlers are updated with revised content or new items. The best way to keep track of language-related commits to ~TiddlyWiki5:master is to monitor this RSS/Atom feed:
