title: TiddlyWiki Drag and Drop Interoperability

It is straightforward to allow any HTML file to interoperate with TiddlyWiki's drag and drop implementation.

This example shows how to attach draggable data to a DOM element. The data is provided in two different forms:

* the string data is used if the element is dragged onto a text editing area
* the tiddler data is used if the element is dragged into TiddlyWiki's import area
