~TiddlyWiki has two approaches to saving the user data (tiddlers) depending on whether you are using the single file version, or are using the node.js server.

!! Client Server Configuration

~TiddlyWiki on node.js saves each tiddler in a separate text file. For details on the file formats supported for tiddlers on node.js.

!! Single File Wiki

The single file version of ~TiddlyWiki saves the tiddlers within the HTML file. See [[Data Storage in Single File TiddlyWiki]]
