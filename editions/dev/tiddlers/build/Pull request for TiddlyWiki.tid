title: Pull request for TiddlyWiki

!! Changelog categories

These are the categories used by Pull Request Summary lines as outlined in the [ext[PR Template|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md]]
In the end, it's up to the author to decide where ''they'' want their change to be listed, these are only guidelines, not rules.

!!! None

Please consider a summary of "SUMMARY: None" for minor additions, fixes, and documentation changes. There are far too many changes made to the core to feature anything approaching all of them in the changelog. (Do not add any description in quotes - e.g., SUMMARY: None "whatever" - after a summary of "None".)

!!! Usability

Adding new functionality to the wiki is a feature. These will generally be edits to the JS code in the core, though new wikitext may be involved as well.

!!! Widget

Make changes to core widgets, to support new attributes or improve performances.

!!! Filter

Add new core filters, or improve existing ones to support new parameters.

!!! Hackability

Usually this means extends what is capable to do within a community plugin. Or refactor the wikitext to make it easier to read and modify by the community.

!!! Document

Improving documents in editions/ folder.

!!! Plugin

If a change is either contained within an official plugin, it goes in this category.

!!! Server

Client-server improvements, or changes to the server code itself, including new command line options.

!!! Performance

When there's no functional change at all except for less execution time, it's performance.

These will almost always happen in JS code.

!!! Infrastructure

These are changes for programmers, by programmers.
Most users will never even know these happened, but they'll appreciate the improved stability and features that this kind of things enables.

All manner of refactor and overhaul oriented at making the wiki easier to work on, and improvements to developer experiences fit in this category.

These will frequently be JS changes, but wikitext reorganization also fits, as does development of tools that run outside the wiki.

!!! Translation

We want everyone to enjoy TiddlyWiki, so we do translations.

Changes oriented at letting everyone use TiddlyWiki no matter what their language go here.

!!! Accessibility

Make wiki accessible to users without colour vision, or with other disabilities.

About theme and palette.

This is for major new features, new plugins, new filters, new commands, new wikitext, new anything.

!!! modified
