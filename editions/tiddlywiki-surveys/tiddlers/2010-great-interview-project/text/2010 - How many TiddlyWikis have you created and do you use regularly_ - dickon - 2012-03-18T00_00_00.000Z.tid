At least 20<br><br>Some I use all the time (the <a class="tiddlySpaceLink externalLink" tiddlyspace="ambit" href="http://ambit.tiddlyspace.com/">ambit</a> manual is probably my peak!)<br><br>My NHS team uses an offline TW (securely stored) to track and document all the clients we treat, documenting team discussion in the TW, and printing out these tiddlers for pasting into the conventional paper notes.  The TW is projected and edited during every team meeting, and the act of typing into it has become part of our efforts towards "transparent practice"...<br><br>I use TW's for major literature reviews - fantastic for cross referencing, tagging, ensuring that I have integrated a disparate body of literature.<br><br>I use TW's in management meetings to make wikified minutes - people get intrigued and wnat to understand and that often deepens the discussion - what are the underlying themes (Tags) that we are REALLY trying to crack in this meeting?<br><br>etc...<br><br><br>
