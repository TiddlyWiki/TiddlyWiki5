title: 2010 - What do you think of the name TiddlyWiki and the term "tiddler"? - andrewbarbour - 2010-11-28T00:00:00.000Z

"Tiddlywiki" - kind of 'folksy' and quaint.  Has a bit of charm.<br><br>"Tiddler" - is a bit of a barrier to adoption.  I have tried to give overviews to a few people and used the term 'tiddler' - at least 50% of the time there are chuckles and references to 'diddlers'.   I would suggest calling them 'items' or 'posting'.<br>
