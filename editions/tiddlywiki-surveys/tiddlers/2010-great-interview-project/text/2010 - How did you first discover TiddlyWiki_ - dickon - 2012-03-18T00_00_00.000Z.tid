title: 2010 - How did you first discover TiddlyWiki? - dickon - 2012-03-18T00:00:00.000Z

I have known and loved Jeremy Ruston for many years, so it was word of (horse's) mouth.<br><br>It is strange when you have known someone for many years; suddenly to discover how something so excellent has been going on in their work (that had always seemed so far away from your own) - and that it absolutely answers what you are after... kerrr-ching!<br><br>I got curious about what this Tiddly stuff was about in conversation, and Jeremy sent me a link, which I started looking at in about 2005 I think.  As a total non-techy I commend my own bravery in trying to get past the somewhat opaque documentation, but there was a fairly sudden "lights came on" moment when I saw massive potential in what was on offer, that I had seen nowhere else.<br>
