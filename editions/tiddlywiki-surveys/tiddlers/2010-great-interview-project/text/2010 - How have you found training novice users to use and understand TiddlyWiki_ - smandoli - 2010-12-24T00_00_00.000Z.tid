title: 2010 - How have you found training novice users to use and understand TiddlyWiki? - smandoli - 2010-12-24T00:00:00.000Z

It's reminiscent of entering the Linux world as a home user.  The information is there, but you may have to search.  Advice is plenteous, but you must learn to sort through it for the bits that apply.  Advisors are friendly, but you must be brave enough and interested enough to participate in a forum.  <br><hr><strong>Suggested Question (related):</strong>  What is your experience introducing TiddlyWiki to other people?<br><ul><li> The hard part is convincing them it's useful and they should take it on.  I start by explaining "personal information management" and then I check the eyes for any spark of interest.  </li><li> The obvious solution is to present not TiddlyWiki but rather a largish wiki of interesting information, and then make them aware of the vehicle.  </li></ul><br>
