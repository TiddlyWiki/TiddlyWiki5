title: 2010 - What do you think of the name TiddlyWiki and the term "tiddler"? - frankfurtkid - 2010-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

I got used to it - but when introducing people to these terms for the first time, they have to get over the smiles. Usually the functionality wins over, but I've had feedback that it does not sound very professional - but hey what does Google or Twitter sound like ? Also sounds much better than Edit Conflict - which I just got saving this tiddler<br>
