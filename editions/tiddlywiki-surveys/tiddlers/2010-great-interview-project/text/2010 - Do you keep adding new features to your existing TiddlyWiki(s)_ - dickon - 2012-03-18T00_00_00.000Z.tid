To some extent, but I find that it is a "marker" of where the task (that underlies the reason for setting up the TW in the first place) has got to when I <em>slow down</em> on the modifications!  I hasten to add I only do pretty simple modifications, and tend to use the same small number of plugins or techniques again and again.<br>
