title: 2010 - How have you found training novice users to use and understand TiddlyWiki? - rouilj - 2010-11-27T00:00:00.000Z

The coursebook I created was well received by a couple of participants, but there were also three people who found it difficult to use and understand. They found it got in the way of learning the material compared to the pdf format that other teachers used for their classes.<br><br>Plus I had a couple of people with old version of firefox (1.x) that made it unusable.<br><br>If I could teach the course again, I think I would have to spend time teaching how to use tiddlywiki (and the coursebook) to even a technologically experienced audience.<br>
