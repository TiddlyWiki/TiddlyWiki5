in reply to <a href="javascript:;" title="How did you first discover TiddlyWiki? - jermolene, 16/11/2010, 14:18:55" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="How did you first discover TiddlyWiki?">How did you first discover TiddlyWiki?</a>:<br><br>After few months into my graduate studies in Brain Imaging I realized that my poor brain, by itself, won't suffice to keep all the information related to various projects organized. I started looking into various softwares like Evernote, <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'OneNote' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="OneNote" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/webid4me_public&quot;">OneNote</a>, google docs etc etc. I quiickly realized that: (1) all these tools are proprietary solutions to attract people by visual cues and, ironically, do not work well in academic workflow like mine. (2) Most of them lacked native support for Linux OS. (3) Almost all of them lacked proper math typesetting support. <br><br>I gave up and started using mix of plain text and latex (notes.txt, notes_math.txt). It kind of worked for about an year. Then I realized that I really need support for hypertext in my notes - That led me to start fiddling with markdown - but it was not covenient as I needed to convert to html each time I made changes. Some more surfing and searching brought me to Tiddlywiki (now called Classic TW). <br><br>I was stunned by Tiddlywiki not only because it is a singlefile wiki application but also because it is a useful example of Quine :) I always understood that I need a 'wiki' for my note taking habbits but I could never imagine that a wiki software could be as portable as a single file. <br>
