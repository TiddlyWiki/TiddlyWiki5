title: 2010 - What was it about TiddlyWiki that captured your interest? - mama - 2010-11-20T00:00:00.000Z

I'm sure that it was the "tiddler-approach" which caught my attention... Other wikis I tried in the past, always made me a little uneasy because of the "one article one page" layout. I quickly understood that <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/mama_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> could be tweaked to my own liking - and when I eventually overcame my reluctance to enroll in a community, the googlegroup convinced me that even I, could create/modify a copy to my own liking, a total noob, with no education or knowledge whatsoever about html, css or javascript.<br>As far as I remember, I tried to figure things out for myself for about six months untill I finally gave up - and posted a question on the usergroup. At that time I was trying to create a tiddlywikiapp to be used on a mobile phone for administration of students at my school. <a class="externalLink" href="http://himmerlands-ungdomsskole.dk/" title="External link to http://himmerlands-ungdomsskole.dk" target="_blank">http://himmerlands-ungdomsskole.dk</a>. I even purchased an old HTC (tytn II) to be able to test the thing....<br>
