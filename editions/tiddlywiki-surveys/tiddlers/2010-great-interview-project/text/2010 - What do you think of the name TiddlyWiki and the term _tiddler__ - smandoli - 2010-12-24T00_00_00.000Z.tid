Those are good terms.  I have nothing better.  That said, I always introduce the terms with just a bit of anxiety!  And i explain them with a big roll of the eyes and a chuckle.  Once I'm past that, all is well.  And it may be all for the good.  Enough with haughty tech terms, with applications that impress the new user with fear before anything else.  <br>
