title: 2010 - What was it about TiddlyWiki that captured your interest? - dickon - 2012-03-18T00:00:00.000Z

It was the fact that it was a <em>document</em>, but that it had certain aspects that seemed extraordinarily "three-dimensional": pages (tiddlers) have <em>depth</em> insofar as each chunk of content that you write has what I think of as both <em>centrifugal</em> force (stimulating interest to go and explore links and tags that offered related material) balanced by <em>centripetal</em> force (the intrinsic interest of what is here on this page/tiddler, that holds my attention and delivers what I want/need.)<br><br>But more than that, <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> has EDGES; this is like other documents I know about (chiefly paper based), and is reassuring in relation to the scary 'anarchy of limitlessness' that, say, Wikipedia has.  As a TW could be a thing - downloaded, uploaded - so it was a <em>definable entity</em>; there could be a balance of authorial control with the wiki-like sharing and co-construction.<br><br>I was writing a large treatment manual at the time (with a great group of co-authors based around the <a class="externalLink" href="http://annafreud.org/" title="External link to http://annafreud.org" target="_blank">Anna Freud Centre</a>) at the time, and we were trying to integrate a whole range of "schools" of thinking and practising into a concentrated, integrated set of principles and practices that could 'steer' workers in the field towards more effective practice in doing therapy with some of the most vulnerable, complex, troubled youth around.  The "eureka" moment (and it was something like that) was the recognition of a number of things almost simultaneously:<br><br><h1>'Integrative' format</h1><br>1. That the way to mount all this information was in a <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a>: this format could emphasise underlying links/commonalities/shared concepts between disparate schools (that had often, in my view, wasted precious energy on "turf wars"... this seemed to me to be a radically <em>integrative format</em>, insofar as any tiddler that I wrote automatically begged the questions: <em>"How does my content fit in with the rest of what is written?  How are you going to tag me?  What links are you going to place in me, and to me?"</em><br><br><h1>Funkier than a book</h1><br>2. The format (with its promise of embedded video, downloadable documents, clickable links...) offered a much more tempting "front door" to what is conventionally a massively boring kind of book. (Research demonstrates that the "treatment manual" is frequently despised by therapists, who find them rigid, condescending, crushing of creativity and spontaneity, and often ill-fitting to their local setting and cultural context.)  Most treatment manuals are not inviting to the casual browser!<br><br><h1>Open source works for therapy, too</h1><br>3. The whole "open source" ethos that Tiddlywiki abounds with, absolutely fitted with the slant on human behaviour/psychology that we were using as the "integrating principle" in our treatment approach, which is "<a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'Mentalization' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="Mentalization" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">Mentalization</a>".  The motto of open source programmers ("Release Early, Release Often") fits the mentalization-based therapist's assumption that "I only see with partial vision" and his or her willingness to mark their <em>best guesses</em> as just that - hypotheses, to be built on and improved...<br><br><h1>Multiple iterations around a developing shared core</h1><br>4. The final "Bingo!" moment was the realisation that with <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> it was possible to conceive of multiple locally-adapted versions of a centrally-curated 'basic core' offering.   Thus local teams (the "small trusted groups" that <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlySpace' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlySpace" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlySpace</a> refers to) can work out <em>place- and population-specific iterations</em> of "Practice-based Evidence" - that fit the more rarefied/less 'attuned' "Evidence-based Practice" into <em>local settings, local populations</em>.  I think of it as being like adapting a basic car for use in different parts of the world - some places need air-con, others need 4 wheel drive and a good in-cabin heater, still others need an excellent paint job, etc... but all rely on a basic car that basically runs.  <br><br>With the development of <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlyWeb' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWeb" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlyWeb</a> and <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlySpace' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlySpace" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlySpace</a> this vision (no. 4 above) has become increasingly possible, so that now the <a class="tiddlySpaceLink externalLink" tiddlyspace="ambit" href="http://ambit.tiddlyspace.com/">ambit</a> core manual is <em><strong>included</strong></em> in the local versions of just under 20 teams across the UK (see <a class="tiddlySpaceLink externalLink" tiddlyspace="tiddlymanuals" href="http://tiddlymanuals.tiddlyspace.com/">tiddlymanuals</a> and follow the links for AMBIT), working with diverse populations, and in diverse ways, with "hard to reach" young people.  <br><br>These teams are beginning to build their own locally-attuned versions of a treatment manual, building on (and often improving on) the ambit 'core'.  As time goes on, and evidence is gathered about what works for whom, we hope to bring excellent local adaptations that would have more general relevance into the core, so that they are automatically available to all other local teams including this core.<br>
