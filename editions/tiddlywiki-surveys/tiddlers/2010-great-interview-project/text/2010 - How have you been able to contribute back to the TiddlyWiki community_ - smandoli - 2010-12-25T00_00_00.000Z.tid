I haven't yet.  I am looking forward to answering questions from complete newbies ... after I'm not one myself.  I am a communicator, and I'd like to develop tutorial pieces.  I'm not a coder and I'm not very tech (my tutorial would not be a video).  I wouldn't mind sending some money but I feel it's not appropriate with my finances.  <br>
