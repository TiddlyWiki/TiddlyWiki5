title: 2010 - How did you first discover TiddlyWiki? - frankfurtkid - 2010-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

i was looking for a simple wiki to use for note keeping, action tracking and the like - I think I was reading "Getting Things Done" at the time. I came across <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/frankfurtkid_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> and decided to give it a try. I liked the idea of not needing to be online - which at the time was less frequent than now. I then discovered that the guys involved worked for the same company as I do - and that made me really interested in using it for work as well as private applications. <br><br>Then server side became more important - ability to share info and access. I used cctiddly for a while and am now starting to use the BT green side implementation of <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlySpace' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlySpace" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/frankfurtkid_public&quot;">TiddlySpace</a> for work related projects - as well as the usual tiddlyspace.com.  <br>
