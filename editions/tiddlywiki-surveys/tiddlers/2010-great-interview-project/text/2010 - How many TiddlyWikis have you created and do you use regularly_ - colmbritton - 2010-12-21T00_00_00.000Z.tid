All in all I have created a fair few, however I have 3 main ones (or used to until Tiddlyspace came around). They are one for general notes, one for recording info and ideas about the projects I was working on and a third, which was a test TW that I used to try out new plugins and combinations of plugins.<br>Now that I am on Tiddlyspace I have a lot!<br>
