title: 2010 - What was it about TiddlyWiki that captured your interest? - martinlindner - 2010-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

initially: i think i was fascinated by the idea of having  a "page" made of dynamic paragraphs, back then. i'm still interested in the (abandoned?) TW project of importing docs, transforming paragraphs to tiddlers, and back again.<br><br>the other concept i have been obsessed with since 2004 is "microcontent": to play with small units of meaning, meme-like chunks. like the microweb that exploded after that, with twitter &amp; any kind of 'microformatted' apps (for questions, for trips, for reviewas, for nearly anything).<br>
