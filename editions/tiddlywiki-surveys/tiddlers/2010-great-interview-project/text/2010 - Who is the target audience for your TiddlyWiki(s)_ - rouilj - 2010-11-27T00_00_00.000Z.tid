title: 2010 - Who is the target audience for your TiddlyWiki(s)? - rouilj - 2010-11-27T00:00:00.000Z

For most of TW's I am the primary audience.<br><br>The one TW I produced for others was a coursebook that was used to teach an event correlation tool to computer system administrators.<br><br>I am also occasionally playing with using a TW as a blogging platform which would again be geared toward items of interest to system administrators and people who are interested in lean/six sigma and its use in computing environments.<br>
