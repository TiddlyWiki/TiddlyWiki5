title: 2010 - Do you keep adding new features to your existing TiddlyWiki(s)? - frankfurtkid - 2010-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

My standalone Tiddlywikis are pretty static now, although I find the odd plugin from time to time. Tiddlyspace is completely different as its changing all the time - so its still very much a learning as I go along experience, and adding in new features as I discover them. I still need to really think about how I want to use <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlySpace' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlySpace" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/frankfurtkid_public&quot;">TiddlySpace</a> - not there yet. the songs.tiddlyspace.com project is more geared to multiple people accessing the same site - and I want to get that working in a more collaborative fashion - so following / sharing information etc is important.<br>
