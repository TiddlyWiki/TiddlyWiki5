title: 2010 - How many TiddlyWikis have you created and do you use regularly? - rouilj - 2010-11-27T00:00:00.000Z

I use four on a regular basis:<br><br><ul><li> tbGTD - for getting things done</li><li> twab - for an address book and I have extended it to allow tracking things like who gets christmas cards etc</li><li> coursebook - was created as a textbook/exercise-quiz/presentation tool/student notebook for a class I was teaching.</li><li> <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlySnip' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlySnip" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/rouilj_public&quot;">TiddlySnip</a> - sadly this has been abandoned, but it is my primary mechanism for keeping bookmarks, research notes and how to's for the firefox browser.</li></ul><br>
