title: 2010 - How has the TiddlyWiki community helped you? - mama - 2010-11-26T00:00:00.000Z

I don't think I would use (or be able to use) TW today if it hadn't been for the <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/mama_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> googlegroup.<br>People on the discussionboard, has always been very kind and helpfull - and sometimes I have learned a lesson or two about discipline as well :-)<br>There's a lot to learn from the threads, and its great to ask a question and get (almost) immediate response.<br>For a newbie it's a fantastic and inspiring experience to get help from a gifted programmer, who explains things in a way that is enligtening and thoughtprovoking... It's a joy, when someone steps into a thread with a snippet of code, which solves everything :-)<br>It's communication at a level, I don't find many other places, and it's certainly an oasis, a sanctuary to find in a web which is mostly a marketplace where everyone is considered to be a potential customer...<br>The generousity of really great programmers like Eric Shulmann (on the other hand, Eric MUST be one of a kind...), the Osmosoftteam and several/many individuals who invest their sparetime, helping other people to use <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/mama_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a>, is an outstanding example of a meltingpot of ressources, that you simply NEED to follow, because it's unique, magic and active.<br>You don't know for how long it will last - and I sometimes think that the community survives/thrives because different "teams" of really enthusiastic people choose to discuss matters that could be discussed in the privacy of their own mailboxes :-)<br>That's ok - and certainly gives you a window to a world of things, you wouldn't know existed elsewise....<br>If it wasn't for the community I don't think there would be a <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/mama_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> - on the other hand I'm not sure if <a href="javascript:;" title="TiddlyWiki - jermolene, 15/11/2010, 17:20:58" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWiki" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/mama_public&quot;">TiddlyWiki</a> would be considered to be a serious project if it wasn't for the Osmosoft Team - so congratulations to everybody :-)<br><br>It's an inspiring meltingpot of users, programmers and enthusiasts - communicating and helping each other to achieve both practical and magic stuff with a onepage html/javascript application<br><br>
