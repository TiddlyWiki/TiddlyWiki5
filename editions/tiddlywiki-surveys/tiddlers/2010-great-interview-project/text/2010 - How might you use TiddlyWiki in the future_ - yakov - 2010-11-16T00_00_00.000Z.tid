title: 2010 - How might you use TiddlyWiki in the future? - yakov - 2010-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

Aside those many writings including scientific ones, aggregation uses like GTD or question or news aggregation and possible use for site I'd like to mention the concept which TW allows to implement.<br><br>The IT world is very conservative in one thing: tree-based file systems. This just limits the mind. For instance, I used to sort music in my mobile phone by making folders so that I can accent the value of different tracks and this helps me to introduce some harmony in searching music that's proper for the moment. But eventually this came to too branched tree and tracks that has value in more than one sences became binded with this separation.<br><br>Such a thing happens sometimes with all other things: notes, books.. whatever. TW makes a breakthrough here and after some tweaking can reorganize things so that I can forget about the eclectic branched limits. I haven't dig in this direction yet but I know that there are already somewhat player plugins based on web-technologies.. So this may be of interest.<br><br>Hi-hi. Perhaps TW also will be usefull for organizing code for programming but this sounds rather fansy (as for now).<br>
