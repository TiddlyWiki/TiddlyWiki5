My answer won't be very interesting since I'm only studying TW now. I've already created 3 TW for some science and one for making a deep TW tutorial (with many practical aspects).<br><br>However, I'm going to make much more <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TWs' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TWs" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/yakov_public&quot;">TWs</a> for different purposes from questions aggregating to making a site.<br><br>UPD: As for now, I use 9 tw-documents. 3 of them very often and others from time to time. I feel that an offline analogue of <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlyWeb' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyWeb" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/yakov_public&quot;">TiddlyWeb</a> becomes more more desirable thing.<br>
