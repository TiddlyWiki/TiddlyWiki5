I get about 4-500 hits a month to my Tiddlymanuals at present, which compared to how many people regularly read treatment manuals is, in my book, quite good going for a new project.<br><br>There are about 17 teams starting to use and adapt their own local versions of a <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlyManual' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyManual" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/dickon_public&quot;">TiddlyManual</a> around the UK, and these vary in size from about 4 or 5 up to about 25.<br>
