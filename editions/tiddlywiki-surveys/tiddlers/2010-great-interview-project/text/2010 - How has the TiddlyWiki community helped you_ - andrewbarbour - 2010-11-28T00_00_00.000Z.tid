title: 2010 - How has the TiddlyWiki community helped you? - andrewbarbour - 2010-11-28T00:00:00.000Z

The TW community is incredible.  I have never been exposed to a group of folks that have more passion and are so willing to give of their time and expertise.  <br><br>I was looking for a tool to pull back search results for individual lines in tiddlers so I posted on the google groups page.... I had a large number of direct responses with ideas as well as postings to the forum.  The input invaluable - and the outcome entirely satisfactory - someone had already written the code (Thanks Eric!) and I was able to integrate it into my tiddlywiki within minutes.<br><br>Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful!<br>
