title: 2010 - How might you use TiddlyWiki in the future? - martinlindner - 2010-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

I'd love to have a fully working version of <a href="javascript:;" title="The tiddler 'TiddlyDocs' doesn't yet exist" class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting" refresh="link" tiddlylink="TiddlyDocs" tiddlyfields="server.type:&quot;tiddlyweb&quot; server.host:&quot;http://interview.tiddlyspace.com&quot; server.workspace:&quot;bags/martinlindner_public&quot;">TiddlyDocs</a>, all by myself, which would be able to import docs.<br>And I can imagine a lot uf uses as soon as i would be able to read/write/edit tiddlers from a client, (something like a twitter client where i could search for a thread of tiddlers, or subscribe to a tag).<br>
