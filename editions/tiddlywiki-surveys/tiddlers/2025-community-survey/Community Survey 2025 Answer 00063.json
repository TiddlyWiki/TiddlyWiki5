The recent surge in markdown note-taking and knowledge management systems is tempting, but I mostly stick to Tiddlywiki for familiarity and the setup I've already curated.\nIt does seem like TW has the possibility of getting stalled in development, particularly with one main developer.\nI think TW could use some improvements in loading performance, particularly with the NodeJS version which seems like it could be better optimized.",
