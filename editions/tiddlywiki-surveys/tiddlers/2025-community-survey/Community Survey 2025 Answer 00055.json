        "project-weaknesses": "If we bend over backwards trying to please imaginary people who see TW as a no-effort service, I might just stop following TW's development and prefer to stick with an older, stable version indefinitely. Such people either don't exist, or they already have the tool they need (MS or Google Office).\n\nAlso what's missing from TW's documentation is a CSS tutorial. People often overlook that basic CSS skills are a prerequisite for creating appealing interfaces.",
