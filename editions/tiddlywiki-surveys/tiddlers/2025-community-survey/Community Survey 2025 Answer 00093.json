        "tw-customisations": "Far too many to be exhaustive within the limit, but it includes stylesheets, macros, ViewTemplates, and core edits.

It is anything you want it to be, if you put your mind to it.",

My relationship with TW would change if it was officially incorporated (core plugins, etc).\n- Multi-user solutions are technically possible to DIY as a novice programmer, but impossible to make fully usable. It is my only lasting problem with TW because it means I can rarely use this powerful software in collaborative projects, or teach it to others hands-on. An *easy to use* solution for multi-users that can handle conflicting edits would be my dream come true!",
