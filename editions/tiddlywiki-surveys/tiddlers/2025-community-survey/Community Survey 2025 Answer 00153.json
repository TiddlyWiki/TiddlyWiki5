This made me discard tiddlywiki as an option, probably more people do it too\n\nI'm affraid Tiddlywiki is not suported in older or future browsers since it uses lots of javascript.\n\nIt feels tiddlywiki is quite complete, tbh. I don't see how could I contribute work to the project. I can donate money, though.",
