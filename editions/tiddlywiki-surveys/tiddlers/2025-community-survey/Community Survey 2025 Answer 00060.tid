project-strengths: Not adding too much, making sure what is added works properly,
project-weaknesses: Better keyboard-based navigation would be nice.  I also use simplenote and would actually prefer to do everything in TiddlyWiki but it currently easier to navigate solely by keyboard in SImpleNote.  To-Dos could improve without much complication as could calendar-based events.
