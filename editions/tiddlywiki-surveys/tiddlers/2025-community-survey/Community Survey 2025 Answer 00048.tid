project-strengths: Portability/archiveability are working well. Project is long-standing and has a good track record in my book.
project-weaknesses: I need some built-in system that allows multiple editors (at the same time)/roles/permissions. There is some progression towards that, but to me, that needs to be improved sooner rather than later. An improved undo/trash system (using a wonky plugin for that at the moment) is also something I'd consider basic functionality that is missing. Both whilst keeping the ability to download everything as a single html file, as that aspect of TiddlyWiki is paramount to me.
