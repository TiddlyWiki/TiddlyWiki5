I guess I could contribute more where Design, HTML, CSS is needed. Yet I want to learn and dive deeper into TW. I still struggle with GIT and Node. If I had one wish right now I would like to be able to put the sidebar left or right and the main buttons top or buttom on mobile and left or right on the desktop. Multi-user capability is probably asking too much. :)",
