The concepts are great, but the initial user experience of setting it up (fighting browser security with single file, or setting up node, or tiddlyhost solutions) is a high first step. \n\nSmall community is indicative of a project that isn't really growing, and IMHO not reaching it's potential. Small community means limited users and testers, many of whom are happy to solve problems - but not indicative of the broader userbase\n\n",
