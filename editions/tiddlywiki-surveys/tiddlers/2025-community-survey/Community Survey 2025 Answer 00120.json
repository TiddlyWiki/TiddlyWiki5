While it can take some time to learn and setup, it can be customized and used like no other tool out there. It has a great team of core developers, and the improvements made to the scripting options over the past few years have been very helpful and well executed. I particularly like the addition of widgets and functions.",
        "project-weaknesses": "I stopped using tiddlywiki for a while because I don’t find the editing experience as nice as other tools like Logseq or obsidian where only the part of the page being edited is shown as the raw text, but those tools don’t feature anything close to the built in power tiddlywiki provides for connecting information. I think localized editing would be a nice feature to implement but don’t really know how that would change the tool. I also feel saving wikis in general should not be so complicated.",
