The discussions, the leadership of the project, the very helpful community, the minimalist empty layout, and the overall design are all strong aspects of TiddlyWiki. One thing that would be very useful is a centralized 'how-to' website summarizing tips and tricks. Another positive aspect is the willingness to break backward compatibility when necessary — software needs the freedom to evolve. ;)",
        "project-weaknesses": "The built-in editor doesn't support syntax highlighting!, and there's currently no dedicated theme for CodeMirror, even though the older version of TiddlyWiki 2.x included one. Additionally, Markdown integration remains limited and could benefit from deeper support. File saving continues to be a major pain point when recommending TiddlyWiki to others—improper saving often goes unnoticed, resulting in potential data loss.",
