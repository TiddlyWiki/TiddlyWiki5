For my personal notes I am using Obsidian simply because it's easier to use.\n\nNon-text files are difficult to work with. Setting up a Github saver with Canonical URI or something similar takes days for someone like me.\n\nIt would also be helpful if filters could be built using a UI. \n\nCompared to Obsidian or Notion, TW's user base is small, and I'm not too confident that TW will be able to complete in the long term.",
