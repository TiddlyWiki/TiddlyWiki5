It uses WikiText for formatting and supports HTML as well, while a great majority of software uses Markdown while stripping HTML compatibility, which I am not fond of.",

However, I am still new to TiddlyWiki, and I am starting to open up to the idea. I have not interacted with the TiddlyWiki community yet, nor have I witnessed its decision-making process, so I cannot comment on that, hence why I selected 'No' on the satisfaction question.",
