This relates mostly to the descriptions of the various elements such as filter operators and widgets, no so much the concepts.\nThe community at TW Talk can be very enlightening. There are some contributors (mostly the core programmers and Eric) whose posts I will read for every topic that I'm interested in. There are a few who mostly contribute noise that I tend to skip.",

PRs often seem to fizzle out because a small group of people dominate PR discussions with their opinions on what should be done and what not. Making PRs is a lot of work and being declared \"plugin-material\" too late in the process is frustrating.\nI would generally like to see a tighter Markdown integration and maybe even a preference towards Markdown for newly-created wikis to help new users.",
