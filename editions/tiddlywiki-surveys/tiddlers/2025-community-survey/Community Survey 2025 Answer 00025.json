I am dyslexic, can't code, so I can't participate in the TW community. Most of what is written in the help for discussion forums I don't understand. Not only the technical stuff, but even the very basic stuff, e.g., I don't even know what a plugin is. If there is a some really BASIC training tutorials (like for an 8 year old) to help me understand the jargon/language, this would enable me to contribute.",
