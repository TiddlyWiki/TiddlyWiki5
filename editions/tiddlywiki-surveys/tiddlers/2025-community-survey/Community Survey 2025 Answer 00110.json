After trial and error I usually settle for a clumsy solution BECAUSE I don't comprehend the \"expert solution\". \n* I'd love to help develop a beginner/non-coder scaffold-learning layer to TW.com resources. I got the feeling \"this\" might be considered redundant since there's already Grok, etc. (Grok didn't match my needs/interests)",
