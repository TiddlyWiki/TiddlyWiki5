More importantly, people that really think out of the box. I have used a lot of geeky 'productivity' software, mostly from the Linux side (think suckless) and TW is the only community that doesn't care for labels, but just the best solution.",
        "project-weaknesses": "The styling needs a revamp. The standard font sizes are a good indicator of that, especially on tabs. I think this change must come from the project itself.\n\nThe website should have its structure reconsidered and probably show less info upfront. We need new users.\n\nI'm wary of a gradual split in the ecosystem (core+plugin devs) between single-file and Node.\n\nThe standard distribution should be more featureful e.g. by shipping some plugins along w/ the core, which means supporting them too.",
