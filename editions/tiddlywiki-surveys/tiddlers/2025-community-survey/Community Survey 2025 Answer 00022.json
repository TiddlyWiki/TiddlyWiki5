More importantly, people that really think out of the box. I have used a lot of geeky 'productivity' software, mostly from the Linux side (think suckless) and TW is the only community that doesn't care for labels, but just the best solution.",

The standard font sizes are a good indicator of that, especially on tabs. I think this change must come from the project itself.\n\nThe website should have its structure reconsidered and probably show less info upfront. We need new users.\n\nI'm wary of a gradual split in the ecosystem (core+plugin devs) between single-file and Node.\n\nThe standard distribution should be more featureful e.g. by shipping some plugins along w/ the core, which means supporting them too.",
