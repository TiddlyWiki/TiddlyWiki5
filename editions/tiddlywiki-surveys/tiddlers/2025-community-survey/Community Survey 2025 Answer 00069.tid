project-strengths: The self-editing page stuff is good. The flexibility can be daunting but is ultimately good. The wiki format is very useful. The ability to control how and how many tiddlers are displayed is cool. Being plugin-friendly is very useful. The fact that it’s free, the fact that it’s import/export friendly for the most part... The drag and drop features are cool.
project-weaknesses: I’m currently phasing out of tw into just a folder full of sloppy mishmashed files, not because I want to, but because my story is humongous and my wiki is lagging so hard that I’ve lost important writing while editing directly in it. I first moved from google docs to TW for the same reason... googdocs crashed after chapter 13ish, tw crashes after about chapter 50. I’m sad my use case isn’t a neat fit for tw. I looked so hard to find a tool and tw was it. Im out of options. I have to diy it now.

value-of-tw: It has been a limited but useful resource for organizing and writing my fiction and worldbuilding. Being able to search and sort by tags has been especially useful, as well as being able to write in and display html and markdown pages with custom css. Color coded tags, too.
