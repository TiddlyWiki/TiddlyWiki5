        "project-strengths": "I think there is a great culture of keeping the core \"dependency free\" and \"simple\". These seem relative to me, so I'll explain how one outsider (non-TW developer) sees it. There is a good tendency to slow adding new features to ensure cruft doesn't build in the core, everything else is for plugins. Dependency-free because many JavaScript libraries could be added that would do many of the things--writing custom JavaScript for TW means only what is needed gets written. This in-turn drives simple.",
        "project-weaknesses": "I'm excited for the next major version of TW. So much as changed since 5.x.x was started--JavaScript and browser technology has gone through several generations. Thus, the next major version is a chance to choose best practices as the way forward, deprecate and remove previous ways of doing things, and driving opinionated ways of customization to people who aren't in the weeds of the code regularly. It's great to have many ways of doing things, but also it can cause confusion and abandonment.",
