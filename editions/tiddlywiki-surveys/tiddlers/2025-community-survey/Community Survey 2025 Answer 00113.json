It's an extraordinary and beautiful phenomenon!\nUser community is fantastic. \nRelink and Conditional shortcut syntax, functions, better variable handling... are all very welcome shifts in core.\nI am potentially excited about MultiUserWiki, though it won't really mature until it can be served on web and used over http (including authentication), and/or until it integrates with SSO/AD authentication for smooth use on institutional networks.",
