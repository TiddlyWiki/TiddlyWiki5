I've tested several others, but I always come back to it, even it's hard to me, to struggle with the English language. Yes, there is a German translation and a little introduction, but that isn't enough to get a useful TW. So it's still necessary always to use the original documentation and the English-speaking community. Yes, Google can help, but a German-speaking community would make it easier to me.",
