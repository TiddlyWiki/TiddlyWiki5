title: Extracting Translations

The [[Instructions for Translators]] yield a standalone TiddlyWiki HTML file that contains tiddlers corresponding to each translated string.

! Extracting a new language plugin

Use this procedure if the language being submitted is not already present in the TiddlyWiki repository.

# Run the following command in the terminal to generate the tiddler source files for the repository:
#* `tiddlywiki editions/translators/ --verbose --load <path to HTML file> --build output-files`
#*> The source files are generated in `editions/translators/output/language`
# Create the new language folder `languages/xx-XX`
# Copy the language files into the language folder
# Create a `plugin.info` file for the translation
# Create an appropriate flag image in `icon.tid`
# Add the new language to tw5.com
# Submit a pull request

! Updating an existing language plugin

Use this procedure for submissions of updates to language plugins that are already present in the TiddlyWiki repository.

# Run the following command in the terminal to generate the tiddler source files for the repository:
#* `tiddlywiki editions/translators/ --verbose --unpackplugin $:/languages/xx-XX --load <path to HTML file> --build output-files`
#* substituting the appropriate language code for `xx-XX`
# Copy the language files from the edition output folder to the appropriate language directory
#* Take care not to copy any empty `.tid` files
