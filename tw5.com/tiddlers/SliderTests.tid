The status of this slider is stored in the tiddler JackSlider:
<<slider JackSlider "Motovun Jack.jpg" "TiddlyWiki Kitten »" "See the kitten">>

And here's another slider that is also keyed to JackSlider:
<<slider JackSlider Introduction "HelloThere »">>

And here's another slider that contains a video, with the state stored in VideoSlider (currently <<tiddler VideoSlider>>):
<<slider VideoSlider VideoTests "VideoTests »">>

And here's a MiniSlider that works with text, rather than a separate tiddler.
<<slider state:MiniSlider label:"Click me! »" content:"This is the //content// of the slider. The state is stored in MiniSlider">>

And here's a slider that doesn't use a state tiddler:
<<slider label:"Click me! »" content:"This is the //content// of the slider. The state is not retained.">>
