Here are a few features of TiddlyWiki that you can explore:

* Try editing some tiddlers here on tiddlywiki.com to try out the new WikiText. Your changes will not be visible to other users
* If you're running [[Google Chrome Canary|https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs]] you can:
** Modify this wiki, and then download a copy by clicking this button: <<download filename:"TiddlyWiki.html" label:"Save Changes">>
** Download a static copy of the tiddlers that are currently displayed in this wiki by clicking this button: <<download title:"$:/core/static.template.html" filename:"Story.html" label:"Static Wiki">>
* If you're running on a touch browser like Mobile Safari on the iPad or iPhone:
** The zooming chooser appears by swiping into the left edge of the screen. (It's currently broken but you get the idea)
** The zooming navigator appears by swiping in from the right edge of the screen. (It currently only works in the 'Classic' storyview)
* Browse the list of AllTiddlers or the ShadowTiddlers
* Examine the example [[bitmap images|Motovun Jack.jpg]] and [[SVG images|Motovun Jack.svg]]
